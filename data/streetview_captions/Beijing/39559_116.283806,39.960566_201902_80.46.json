The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly white and green, punctuated by numerous windows that reflect the clear blue sky. The street itself is a hive of activity, filled with cars and buses navigating their way through the urban landscape. On the right side of the street, trees add a touch of nature to the scene, their leaves rustling in the unseen breeze. The image is bathed in the bright sunlight of the day, casting long shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings."}
