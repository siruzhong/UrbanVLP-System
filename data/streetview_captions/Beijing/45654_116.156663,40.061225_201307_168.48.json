The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees on both sides, their leaves forming a canopy overhead. The trees are evenly spaced, creating a rhythmic pattern that adds to the visual appeal of the scene. The sky above is a clear blue, devoid of any clouds, suggesting a bright and sunny day. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the green of the trees contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky. The image does not contain any discernible text or countable objects. The relative positions of the trees to each other and to the street create a harmonious balance, making the image a picturesque representation of a typical day in Beijing."}
