The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with buildings on both sides, their facades bathed in the warm glow of the setting sun. Cars are parked neatly along the side of the road, adding a touch of everyday life to the scene. The sky above is a clear blue, with wispy clouds scattered across it, providing a beautiful backdrop to the urban landscape."}
