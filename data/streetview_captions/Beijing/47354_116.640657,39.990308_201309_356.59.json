The street, bathed in the warm glow of the sun, is flanked by trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting long shadows on the ground. The perspective of the image is from the middle of the street, looking down its length, giving a sense of depth and continuity. The image does not contain any text or discernible actions. The relative positions of the objects remain constant, with the trees lining the street and the sky above. The image does not provide enough detail to confidently count the number of trees or other objects. The colors in the image are predominantly green from the trees, blue from the sky, and brown from the ground."}
