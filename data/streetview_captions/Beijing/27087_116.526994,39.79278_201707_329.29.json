The perspective is from a car on the road, giving a driver's eye view of the city's daily life. The highway, divided by a median, stretches out ahead, filled with cars moving in both directions. The sky above is a clear blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds. On either side of the road, lush green trees and bushes add a touch of nature to the urban landscape. In the distance, buildings rise, their silhouettes faint against the sky. The image is a snapshot of life in a busy city, where nature and urban development coexist."}
