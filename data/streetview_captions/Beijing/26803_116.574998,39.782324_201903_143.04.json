The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the clear blue sky. The buildings in the background are tall and modern, their glass facades reflecting the sunlight. The sun is shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene."}
