The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves forming a canopy over the road. A few cars are parked along the side of the road, adding a touch of modern life to the otherwise tranquil setting. In the background, a building with a distinctive curved roof stands out, its architecture hinting at the cultural context of the location. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it, completing the picturesque view of this worldwide landmark."}
