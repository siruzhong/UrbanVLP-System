The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The sky is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly in the top right corner, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The trees, lush and green, line both sides of the street, their leaves forming a natural canopy overhead. In the distance, power lines stretch across the sky, adding a touch of urbanity to the otherwise natural landscape. The image beautifully encapsulates the blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
