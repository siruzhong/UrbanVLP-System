The perspective is from the middle of the street, looking towards the horizon. The sky above is a clear blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds. On either side of the street, lush green trees stand tall, their leaves rustling in the breeze. The street itself is a two-lane road, with a sidewalk running parallel to it on the right side. A few cars can be seen parked along the side of the road, adding a touch of urban life to the otherwise serene setting. The image captures the essence of a typical day in Beijing, with its blend of natural beauty and bustling city life."}
