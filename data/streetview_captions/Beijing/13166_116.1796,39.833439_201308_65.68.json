The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The sky is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it. The sun is shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene.\n\nThe street itself is lined with lush green trees and bushes, adding a touch of nature to the urban setting. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city. Power lines crisscross above the street, a common sight in many urban areas.\n\nThe image is captured using a 360-degree camera, which is evident from the fisheye effect around the edges of the image. This effect gives the viewer a sense of being immersed in the scene, as if they were standing right there on the street in Beijing."}
