The roads are lined with lush green trees, adding a touch of nature to the urban setting. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the roads, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city.\n\nTraffic lights and street signs punctuate the scene, guiding the flow of vehicles and pedestrians.
