The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the image. The street is lined with lush green trees on both sides, their leaves forming a canopy that filters the sunlight, casting dappled shadows on the road below. A white truck is seen driving down the road, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise tranquil setting. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The image beautifully encapsulates the blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
