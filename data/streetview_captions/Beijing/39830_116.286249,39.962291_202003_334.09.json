The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the surroundings. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. Cars are parked neatly on the side of the road, their metallic bodies gleaming under the soft sunlight. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades bathed in the warm glow of the sun. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting long shadows and creating a play of light and shadow on the ground. The image is a beautiful representation of urban life in Beijing, where tradition and modernity coexist harmoniously."}
