The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with buildings on both sides, their facades painted in shades of white and gray, reflecting the urban architecture of the city. Trees and bushes add a touch of greenery to the otherwise concrete landscape. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it, adding depth to the image."}
