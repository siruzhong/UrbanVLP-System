The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the image. The trees, lush and green, stand tall on both sides of the street, their leaves forming a natural canopy overhead. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The image is bathed in the light of day, highlighting the vibrant colors and details of the landscape."}
