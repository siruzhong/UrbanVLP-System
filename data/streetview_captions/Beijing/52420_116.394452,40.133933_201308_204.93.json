The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of a clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow on the scene. In the distance, power lines stretch across the sky, adding a touch of urbanity to the otherwise natural landscape. The image does not contain any text or discernible actions. The relative positions of the objects suggest a well-planned urban layout, with the trees providing a natural canopy over the street. The power lines, while man-made, do not detract from the overall harmony of the scene. The image is a testament to the coexistence of nature and urban development in Beijing."}
