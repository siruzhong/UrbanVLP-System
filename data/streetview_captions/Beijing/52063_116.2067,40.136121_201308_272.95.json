The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze, casting dappled shadows on the pavement below. On the left side of the street, a small building stands, its details obscured by the distance. On the right side, a blue sign stands out against the greenery, though its contents are not discernible. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene."}
