The perspective is from a high vantage point, providing a bird's eye view of the urban landscape. The street, lined with trees and lampposts, stretches out into the distance, flanked by buildings on both sides. Cars are parked neatly along the sides of the road, hinting at the rhythm of city life. The sky above is a hazy blue, casting a soft light over the scene. In the far distance, the faint outline of mountains can be seen, adding a touch of nature to the urban setting."}
