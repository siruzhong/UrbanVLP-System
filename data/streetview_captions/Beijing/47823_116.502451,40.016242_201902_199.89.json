The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the image. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. A red car is parked on the left side of the street, adding a pop of color to the scene. On the right side of the street, a white van is parked, its presence adding a touch of urban life to the otherwise serene setting. The sun shines brightly in the background, casting shadows and highlighting the textures of the trees and buildings. The image beautifully encapsulates a typical day in Beijing, where nature and urban life coexist harmoniously."}
