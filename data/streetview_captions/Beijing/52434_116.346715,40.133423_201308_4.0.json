The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, which is a clear blue with a few scattered clouds. The trees, tall and lush with green leaves, line both sides of the street, creating a natural canopy. The street itself is paved with gray asphalt, and a sidewalk runs parallel to it on the right side. In the distance, a few buildings can be seen, their details softened by the distance. The overall scene is a blend of urban and natural elements, a common sight in many cities around the world."}
