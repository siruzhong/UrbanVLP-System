The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of the towering buildings that line the street. These structures, predominantly white and gray, rise high into the clear blue sky, their glass facades reflecting the sunlight. The street itself is a hive of activity, with cars and buses moving along it, adding a dynamic element to the scene. On either side of the street, trees provide a touch of greenery, their leaves rustling in the breeze. The image is bathed in the warm glow of the sun, casting long shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings."}
