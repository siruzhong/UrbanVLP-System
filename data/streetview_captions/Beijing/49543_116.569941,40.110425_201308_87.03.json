The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees on both sides, their leaves forming a natural canopy overhead. The road, a smooth gray surface, cuts through the center of the image, leading the viewer's eye towards the horizon. On the right side of the road, there's a building with a white facade and a red roof, adding a touch of urban architecture to the otherwise natural landscape. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it, suggesting a bright and sunny day. The image does not contain any text or discernible actions. The relative positions of the objects remain constant, with the trees on either side of the road and the building on the right. The image does not provide enough detail to confidently count the number of trees or buildings. The colors in the image are predominantly green from the trees, blue from the sky, and gray from the road and building."}
