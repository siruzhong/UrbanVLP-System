The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves forming a natural canopy overhead. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting shadows that add depth to the image. The colors are vibrant, with the green of the trees contrasting against the blue of the sky and the varied hues of the buildings."}
