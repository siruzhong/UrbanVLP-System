The street is teeming with life, filled with cars and buses moving in both directions. The buildings that line the street are tall and modern, their facades painted in shades of gray and brown. The sky above is hazy, casting a soft light over the scene. In the distance, the tops of trees can be seen, providing a touch of nature amidst the urban landscape."}
