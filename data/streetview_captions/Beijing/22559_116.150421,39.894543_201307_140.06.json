The street, bathed in the warm glow of the sun, stretches out into the distance, flanked by lush greenery on both sides. A white van is parked on the right side of the street, adding a touch of urban life to the otherwise tranquil setting. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly in the top right corner, casting long shadows and highlighting the vibrant colors of the scene. The perspective of the image is from a low angle, looking down the street towards the horizon, giving a sense of depth and scale to the landscape."}
