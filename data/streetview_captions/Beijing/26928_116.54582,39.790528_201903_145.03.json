The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with buildings of varying heights, their facades painted in a palette of white, gray, and beige, reflecting the urban architecture of the city. Overhead, power lines crisscross the sky, a common sight in many cities. The sky itself is a clear blue, with a smattering of clouds adding depth to the background. The image is bathed in the warm glow of a sunny day, with shadows subtly hinting at the time of day."}
