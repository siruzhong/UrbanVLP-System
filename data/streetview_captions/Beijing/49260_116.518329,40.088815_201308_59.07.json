The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the surroundings. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves forming a canopy that filters the sunlight, casting dappled shadows on the ground. A few people can be seen strolling along the sidewalk, adding a touch of life to the tranquil setting. In the distance, a bridge stretches across the scene, connecting two parts of the city. The colors in the image are predominantly green and gray, reflecting the natural and urban elements of the landscape. The overall effect is a harmonious blend of nature and city life, a characteristic feature of Beijing's urban planning."}
