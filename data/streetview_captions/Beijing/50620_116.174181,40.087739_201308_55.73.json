The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The sky is a clear blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene.\n\nThe street itself is lined with lush green trees and bushes, adding a touch of nature to the urban landscape. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city. Power lines crisscross above, a common sight in many urban areas.\n\nIn the distance, a large billboard stands out, although the content of the billboard is not discernible from this vantage point. The overall scene is a blend of urban development and natural beauty, a characteristic feature of Beijing's cityscape."}
