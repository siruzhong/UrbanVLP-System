The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with buildings on both sides, their architecture hinting at the rich history and culture of the city. The buildings are predominantly beige and white, with occasional red and blue accents adding a splash of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene."}
