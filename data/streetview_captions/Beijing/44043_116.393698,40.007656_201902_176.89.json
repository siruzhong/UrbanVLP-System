The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of the towering buildings that line the street. These structures are tall and modern, their facades adorned with windows that reflect the clear blue sky above. The street itself is a hive of activity, with cars and trucks moving along it, adding a dynamic element to the scene. On the right side of the street, red traffic lights stand sentinel, guiding the flow of vehicles. In the distance, trees add a touch of nature to the urban landscape. The image is bathed in the warm glow of a sunny day, casting long shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings."}
