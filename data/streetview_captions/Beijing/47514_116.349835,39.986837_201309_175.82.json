The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with modern buildings, their facades predominantly gray and white, punctuated by occasional blue and green accents. The buildings rise high into the sky, their tops disappearing into the bright blue expanse above. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow on the scene and creating a lens flare in the image."}
