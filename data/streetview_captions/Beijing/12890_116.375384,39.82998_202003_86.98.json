The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves forming a natural canopy overhead. The buildings in the background are tall and modern, their white facades gleaming under the clear blue sky. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the green of the trees contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky. The overall effect is a harmonious blend of urban architecture and natural elements."}
