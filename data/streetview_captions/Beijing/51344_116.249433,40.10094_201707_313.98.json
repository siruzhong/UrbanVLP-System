The perspective is from a car on the road, providing a driver's eye view of the scene. The street is flanked by lush green trees and bushes, adding a touch of nature to the urban landscape. Overhead, power lines stretch across the sky, connecting the buildings that line the street. The buildings themselves are predominantly white and gray, their neutral tones contrasting with the vibrant greenery. The sky above is a clear blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds. The image is taken from a low angle, which emphasizes the height of the buildings and the expanse of the sky."}
