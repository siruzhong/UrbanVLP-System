The perspective is from a high vantage point, providing a bird's eye view of the site. The site is a hive of activity, with various construction vehicles and equipment scattered across the area, ready to spring into action. The ground is a patchwork of dirt and gravel, a testament to the ongoing work.\n\nIn the distance, the iconic skyline of Beijing looms, punctuated by the towering presence of the Great Hall of the People and the Supreme People's Court. These buildings, symbols of China's political power, stand tall against the backdrop of a clear blue sky, lightly brushed with a few wispy clouds.\n\nThe sun shines brightly in the top right corner of the image, casting long shadows and illuminating the scene with a warm glow. Despite the absence of any human figures, the image is imbued with a sense of purpose and progress, a snapshot of a city in constant evolution."}
