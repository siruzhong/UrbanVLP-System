The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the buildings and the overpass. The buildings, painted in shades of white and gray, stand tall against the backdrop of a clear blue sky. The overpass, constructed of concrete, arches gracefully over the street, supported by sturdy pillars. Cars and buses traverse the street, adding a dynamic element to the scene. The image is bathed in the warm glow of the sun, casting long shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings."}
