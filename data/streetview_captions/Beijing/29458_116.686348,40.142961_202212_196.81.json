The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves forming a natural canopy over the urban landscape. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city. Cars parked along the side of the road add a touch of modern life to the scene. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it, adding depth to the background. The image is slightly distorted due to the fisheye lens used, which gives it a unique, almost surreal quality."}
