The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees and bushes, adding a touch of nature to the urban setting. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city. Power lines crisscross above, a common sight in many urban landscapes.
