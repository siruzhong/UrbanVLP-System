The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. Street lamps stand sentinel along the road, their presence suggesting a warm glow that would light up the street as dusk falls. Buildings rise in the distance, their architecture hinting at the blend of traditional and modern styles that are characteristic of Beijing. The image is bathed in the soft light of day, with shadows adding depth and contrast to the scene."}
