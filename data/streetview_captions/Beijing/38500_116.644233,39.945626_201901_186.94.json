The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of the city's towering structures. The buildings, predominantly white and gray, rise high into the clear blue sky, punctuated by a few scattered clouds. The street below is a hive of activity, with cars and buses moving along the road, their colors muted against the urban backdrop. Overhead, power lines crisscross the sky, a testament to the city's infrastructure. The image is bathed in the warm glow of the sun, casting long shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings."}
