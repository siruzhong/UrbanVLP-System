The road, curving gently to the right, is lined with trees on both sides, creating a natural corridor. The trees, standing tall and proud, are adorned with green leaves that add a vibrant splash of color to the scene. The sky above is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the landscape. The perspective of the image is from a low angle, looking up at the towering trees, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The colors in the image are predominantly green and gray, reflecting the natural hues of the landscape."}
