The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The road, lined with lush green trees and bushes, stretches out ahead, disappearing into the distance. A black SUV is parked on the side of the road, adding a touch of modernity to the otherwise natural landscape. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The image is a beautiful blend of nature and urban life, showcasing the harmony between the two in Beijing."}
