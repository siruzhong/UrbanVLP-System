The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves forming a canopy that filters the sunlight, casting dappled shadows on the pavement below. Cars are parked neatly on the side of the road, their metallic bodies gleaming under the soft light. Buildings rise in the background, their facades adorned with various signs and advertisements, adding a touch of urban charm to the otherwise serene setting. The colors in the image are predominantly green and blue, with hints of gray and brown, creating a harmonious palette that is pleasing to the eye. The image beautifully encapsulates the blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
