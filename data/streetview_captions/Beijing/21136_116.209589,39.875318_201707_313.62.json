The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with buildings and trees, their colors muted under the overcast sky. In the distance, a tall tower stands out, its silhouette stark against the gray backdrop. The image is slightly distorted due to the fisheye lens used, adding a unique perspective to the urban landscape."}
