The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees and shrubs, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few wispy clouds scattered across it. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the green of the trees contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky."}
