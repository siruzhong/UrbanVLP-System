The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the surroundings. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene and creating a lens flare in the top left corner of the image. In the distance, a bridge can be seen, adding another layer of depth to the landscape. The image does not contain any text or discernible actions. The relative positions of the objects suggest a well-planned urban layout, with the trees, sidewalk, and road all neatly aligned. The image is a testament to the harmonious coexistence of nature and urban development in Beijing."}
