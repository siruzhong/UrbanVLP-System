The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings that line the street. These structures, predominantly gray and brown, rise high into the clear blue sky, their windows reflecting the sunlight. The street itself is a hive of activity, with cars and buses moving along its length, adding a dynamic element to the scene. On either side of the street, lush green trees provide a stark contrast to the urban landscape, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. The image is bathed in the warm glow of a sunny day, casting long shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings."}
