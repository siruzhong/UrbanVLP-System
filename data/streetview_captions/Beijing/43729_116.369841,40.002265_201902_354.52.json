The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with modern buildings, their facades made of glass and concrete, reflecting the sunlight and adding a touch of brightness to the day. The buildings vary in height, with some towering over others, creating a dynamic skyline. The trees lining the street are bare, their branches reaching out into the clear blue sky, suggesting that the season might be winter or early spring. The street itself is mostly empty, with only a few cars and pedestrians visible, adding a sense of tranquility to the scene."}
