The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of the towering buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly white and gray, punctuated by occasional red and green accents that add a touch of color to the urban landscape. The street itself is a hive of activity, with cars and taxis in motion, adding a dynamic element to the scene. The sky above is a clear blue, and the sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene."}
