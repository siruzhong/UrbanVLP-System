The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the surroundings. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. A black car is parked on the side of the road, adding a touch of modernity to the otherwise tranquil setting. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it, creating a beautiful contrast with the greenery below. The image is a beautiful representation of the blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
