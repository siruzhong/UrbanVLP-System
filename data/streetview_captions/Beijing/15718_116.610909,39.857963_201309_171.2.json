Among them, a McDonald's restaurant stands out, its familiar logo a stark contrast to the traditional Chinese architecture that surrounds it. \n\nVehicles of various types are scattered across the street, including cars and trucks, adding to the dynamic nature of the scene. Overhead, power lines crisscross against the sky, a common sight in many urban areas.\n\nDespite the busyness of the scene, there's a sense of order and harmony. The buildings, vehicles, and power lines all coexist, each contributing to the unique character of the street.
