The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the buildings and trees that line the street. The buildings, painted in hues of white and beige, are adorned with balconies and awnings, adding character to the cityscape. The trees, lush and green, provide a refreshing contrast to the urban architecture. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene."}
