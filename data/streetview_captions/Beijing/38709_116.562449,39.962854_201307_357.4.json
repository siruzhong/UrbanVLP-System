The perspective is from a street-level view, providing a panoramic view of the site. Dominating the scene are three large metal structures, their blue and white colors standing out against the backdrop of the city. These structures are adorned with Chinese characters, hinting at the cultural context of the location.\n\nThe site itself is a hive of activity, with various construction materials scattered around, ready to be put to use. Despite the apparent chaos, there's a sense of order and purpose, a testament to the meticulous planning that goes into such a project.\n\nIn the background, the cityscape of Beijing unfolds. Buildings of varying heights stretch out into the distance, interspersed with trees that add a touch of green to the urban landscape. The juxtaposition of the construction site and the cityscape paints a picture of a city in constant evolution, where development and nature coexist."}
