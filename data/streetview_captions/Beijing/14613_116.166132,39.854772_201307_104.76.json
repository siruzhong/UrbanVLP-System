The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves forming a canopy over the road. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city. The sky above is a clear blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds. The image is slightly distorted due to the fisheye lens effect, adding a unique perspective to the urban landscape."}
