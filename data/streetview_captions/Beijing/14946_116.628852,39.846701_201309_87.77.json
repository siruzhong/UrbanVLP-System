The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the buildings that line the street. These buildings, painted in hues of white and blue, are adorned with balconies and awnings, adding a touch of architectural charm to the cityscape. \n\nThe street itself is a hive of activity, with cars and buses navigating their way through. Overhead, power lines crisscross the sky, a common sight in many urban areas. The sky above is a clear blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds, providing a beautiful backdrop to the urban hustle and bustle below."}
