The image is bathed in the warm glow of the sun, which shines brightly in the top left corner, casting long shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the overpass.\n\nOverall, the image presents a harmonious blend of nature and architecture, capturing the essence of a vibrant city street in Beijing."}
