The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees and buildings, creating a harmonious blend of nature and architecture. The buildings are predominantly white and gray, with occasional splashes of red and green adding vibrancy to the otherwise monochrome palette. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene."}
