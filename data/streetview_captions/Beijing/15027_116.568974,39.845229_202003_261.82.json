The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the clear blue sky. Power lines crisscross above, adding a touch of urbanity to the otherwise natural landscape. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow on the scene and enhancing the colors of the trees and buildings."}
