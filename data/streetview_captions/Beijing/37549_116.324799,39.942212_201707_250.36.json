The vantage point is from a high angle, providing a bird's eye view of the street below. The street itself is lined with lush green trees, their leaves forming a verdant canopy overhead. Nestled amidst these trees is a tranquil pond, its calm waters reflecting the surrounding greenery.\n\nOn the right side of the street, a white van and a bicycle are parked, adding a touch of everyday life to the scene. On the left side, a building with a green roof stands, its color blending harmoniously with the natural surroundings. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it, completing the picturesque setting. The image does not contain any discernible text. The relative positions of the objects suggest a peaceful coexistence of nature and urban life in this part of Beijing."}
