The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the scene. A stone wall, weathered by time, runs along the left side of the street, adding a rustic charm to the urban landscape. On the right side of the street, a row of trees stands tall, their leaves a vibrant green against the clear blue sky. The street itself is lined with power lines, a common sight in many urban areas. In the distance, a few buildings can be seen, their details softened by the perspective. The overall color palette is dominated by shades of green from the trees and blue from the sky, creating a calm and peaceful atmosphere."}
