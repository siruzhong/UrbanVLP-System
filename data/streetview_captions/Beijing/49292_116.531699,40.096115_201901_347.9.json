The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with buildings on both sides, their facades adorned with red banners and signs, adding a vibrant splash of color to the urban landscape. Cranes, symbols of ongoing construction and development, punctuate the skyline, hinting at the city's continuous growth and transformation. The sky above is hazy, casting a soft, diffused light over the scene."}
