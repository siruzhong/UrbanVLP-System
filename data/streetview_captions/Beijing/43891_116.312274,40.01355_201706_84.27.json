The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, providing a stark contrast to the urban landscape. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city. Cars of different makes and models are parked along the sides of the street, hinting at the busy life of the city. Overhead, power lines crisscross the sky, a common sight in many urban areas. The sky itself is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the scene."}
