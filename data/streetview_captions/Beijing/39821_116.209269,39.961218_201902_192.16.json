The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. Power lines crisscross above, adding a touch of urbanity to the otherwise natural landscape. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city. Cars parked along the side of the road add a modern element to the scene. The image is bathed in the soft light of a sunny day, casting long shadows and highlighting the textures of the trees and buildings."}
