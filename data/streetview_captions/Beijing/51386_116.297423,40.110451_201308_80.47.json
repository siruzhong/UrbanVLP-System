The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees and bushes, adding a touch of nature to the urban landscape. Power lines crisscross above, connecting the buildings that line the street. These buildings, painted in shades of white and beige, stand tall against the backdrop of a clear blue sky. A few clouds are scattered across the sky, adding depth to the scene. The image is bathed in the warm glow of a sunny day, casting long shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings."}
