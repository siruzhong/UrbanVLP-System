The perspective is from a pedestrian's viewpoint on the sidewalk, immersing the viewer in the city's daily life. The street is flanked by buildings on both sides, their facades painted in a palette of mostly beige and brown, punctuated by occasional splashes of red and green. Cars and buses traverse the road, adding a dynamic element to the scene. The sky above is a clear blue, and the sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene."}
