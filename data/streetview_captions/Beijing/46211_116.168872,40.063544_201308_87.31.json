The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees and shrubs, providing a vibrant contrast to the clear blue sky above. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. In the distance, buildings rise, their details softened by the perspective. The image appears to have been captured using a fisheye lens, which distorts the edges of the frame, adding a unique artistic touch to the photograph."}
