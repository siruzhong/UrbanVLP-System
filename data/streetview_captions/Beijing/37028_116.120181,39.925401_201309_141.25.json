The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with buildings on both sides, their gray facades blending harmoniously with the overcast sky above. Power lines crisscross above the street, adding a touch of urbanity to the scene. In the distance, mountains rise, their green and brown hues contrasting with the gray of the cityscape.
