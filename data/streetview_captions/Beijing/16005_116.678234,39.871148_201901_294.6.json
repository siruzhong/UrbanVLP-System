The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. \n\nOn the left side of the street, there are buildings and trees, their greenery contrasting with the urban architecture. On the right side, a fence runs parallel to the street, beyond which lies a construction site, hinting at the ongoing development in the city. \n\nTwo cars, one white and one blue, are parked on the street, adding a touch of everyday life to the scene. A street lamp stands on the corner, ready to illuminate the street as dusk falls. The image beautifully encapsulates a typical day in Beijing, blending urban development with natural beauty."}
