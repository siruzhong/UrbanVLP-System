The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly white and gray, punctuated by occasional red and orange accents that add a splash of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. The sky above is a clear blue, providing a stark contrast to the urban landscape below. The street itself is lined with lush green trees and bushes, adding a touch of nature to the cityscape. Cars can be seen driving on the road, going about their daily routines. The image beautifully encapsulates the blend of urban development and natural elements in Beijing."}
