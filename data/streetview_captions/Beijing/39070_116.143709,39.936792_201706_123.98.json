The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees and shrubs, adding a touch of nature to the urban landscape. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades bathed in sunlight. Overhead, power lines crisscross the sky, a common sight in many cities. The sky itself is a clear blue, with a smattering of clouds adding depth to the background."}
