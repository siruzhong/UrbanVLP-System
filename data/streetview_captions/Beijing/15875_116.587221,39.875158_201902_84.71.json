The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, providing a stark contrast to the clear blue sky above. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades bathed in the soft glow of the sun. Cars are parked neatly on the side of the road, adding a touch of everyday life to the scene. Overhead, power lines crisscross against the backdrop of the sky, a common sight in many urban landscapes.
