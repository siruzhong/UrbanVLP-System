Among these structures, a construction site stands out, hinting at the city's continuous growth and development. \n\nThe street itself is lined with trees, their leaves forming a green canopy that contrasts with the concrete structures. Traffic lights and street signs punctuate the scene, guiding the flow of vehicles and pedestrians. \n\nThe sun shines brightly in the background, casting long shadows and illuminating the scene with a warm glow. Despite the absence of people in the frame, the image conveys a sense of vibrancy and activity, characteristic of a busy city street."}
