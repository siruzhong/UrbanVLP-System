The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the blue sky dotted with white clouds. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. Buildings and power lines can be seen in the distance, adding elements of urban life to the otherwise natural landscape.
