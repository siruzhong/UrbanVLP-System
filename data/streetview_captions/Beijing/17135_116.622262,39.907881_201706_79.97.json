The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves forming a canopy overhead. On the right side of the street, buildings rise, their architecture hinting at the blend of traditional and modern styles that are characteristic of Beijing. The colors in the image are predominantly green and gray, reflecting the natural and man-made elements of the scene. The sky, visible in the background, adds a touch of blue to the otherwise monochromatic palette."}
