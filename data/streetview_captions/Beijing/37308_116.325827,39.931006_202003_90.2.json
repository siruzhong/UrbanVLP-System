The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly white and gray, punctuated by occasional blue and green accents that add a touch of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. The sky above is a clear blue, providing a stark contrast to the urban landscape below. In the distance, power lines crisscross the sky, adding a sense of depth and complexity to the scene. The street itself is lined with trees, their green foliage providing a natural counterpoint to the man-made structures. Cars can be seen driving on the road, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static cityscape."}
