The perspective is from the middle of the street, looking towards the horizon. The sky above is a clear blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds. On either side of the street, there are lush green trees and bushes, adding a touch of nature to the urban setting. \n\nIn the distance, power lines stretch across the scene, connecting the buildings that line the street. These buildings, painted in shades of white and gray, rise up against the sky, their windows reflecting the sunlight. \n\nThe street itself is a two-lane road, marked by a white line running down its center. A few cars can be seen on the road, their colors muted against the vibrant backdrop of the city. The overall scene is a blend of urban development and natural beauty, a characteristic feature of Beijing's cityscape."}
