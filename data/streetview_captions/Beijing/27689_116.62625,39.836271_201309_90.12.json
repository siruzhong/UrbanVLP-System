The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves rustling in the unseen breeze, casting dappled shadows on the asphalt below. The sky above is a clear blue, with a smattering of clouds adding depth to the vast expanse. On the right side of the street, buildings rise, their facades a testament to the architectural prowess of the city. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the green of the trees contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky. The overall scene is a harmonious blend of urban and natural elements, a characteristic feature of Beijing's cityscape."}
