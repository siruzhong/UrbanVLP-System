The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, providing a vibrant contrast to the clear blue sky. Cars are parked neatly on the side of the road, adding to the urban feel of the image. In the distance, modern buildings rise, their glass and steel facades reflecting the sunlight. The sun shines brightly in the top left corner of the image, casting long shadows and illuminating the scene with a warm glow."}
