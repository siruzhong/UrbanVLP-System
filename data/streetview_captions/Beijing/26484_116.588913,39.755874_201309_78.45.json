The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees on both sides, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. A white van is parked on the right side of the street, adding a touch of modernity to the otherwise tranquil setting. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it, suggesting a bright and sunny day. The image is bathed in natural daylight, highlighting the vibrant colors and textures of the scene."}
