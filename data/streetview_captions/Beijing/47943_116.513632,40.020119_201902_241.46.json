The perspective is from a high angle, providing a bird's eye view of the scene. The street is flanked by trees on both sides, their bare branches reaching out towards the clear blue sky. The buildings lining the street are painted in shades of white and gray, their uniform color palette punctuated by occasional red and green accents. Cars and buses are parked along the side of the road, hinting at the hustle and bustle of city life. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene and highlighting the stark contrast between the urban landscape and the natural elements."}
