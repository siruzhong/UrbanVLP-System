The perspective is from a low angle, giving the viewer a sense of being in the scene. The trees, with their lush green leaves, line both sides of the street, creating a natural canopy overhead. The sky, peeking through the top left corner of the image, adds a touch of blue to the otherwise green and brown landscape. The image is slightly distorted due to the fisheye lens effect, adding a unique perspective to the scene."}
