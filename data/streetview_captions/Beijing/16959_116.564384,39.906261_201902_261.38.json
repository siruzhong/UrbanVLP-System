The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with buildings and trees, creating a harmonious blend of urban and natural elements. The buildings, painted in shades of white and gray, rise majestically against the backdrop of a hazy sky. The trees, on the other hand, add a touch of green to the otherwise monochrome palette. In the distance, power lines crisscross the sky, adding a touch of modernity to the scene."}
