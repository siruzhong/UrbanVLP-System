The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees and shrubs, adding a touch of nature to the urban landscape. A few buildings can be seen in the background, their architecture hinting at the blend of traditional and modern styles that characterize Beijing. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it, suggesting a bright and sunny day. The image does not contain any text or specific actions being performed by objects. The relative positions of the objects suggest a well-planned urban layout, with the trees and shrubs neatly lining the street and the buildings standing tall in the background. The image does not provide enough detail to confidently count the number of objects or describe their precise locations. The colors in the image are predominantly green from the trees and shrubs, blue from the sky, and gray from the buildings. The image does not contain any imaginary content and all descriptions are based on the visible content of the image."}
