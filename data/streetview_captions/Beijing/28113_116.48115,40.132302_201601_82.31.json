The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves forming a natural canopy overhead. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades bathed in the warm glow of the sun. In the distance, construction cranes can be seen, indicating ongoing development in the area. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the green of the trees contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky."}
