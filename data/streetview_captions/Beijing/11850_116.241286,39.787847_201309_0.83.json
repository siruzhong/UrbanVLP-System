The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The sky is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly in the top left corner, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The street itself is lined with trees and shrubs, their green hues contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky. In the distance, a few buildings can be seen, adding a touch of urbanity to the otherwise natural landscape. The image is a beautiful representation of the blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
