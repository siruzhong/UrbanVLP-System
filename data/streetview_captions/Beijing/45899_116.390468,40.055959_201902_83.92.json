The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. A white fence runs along the right side of the street, adding a touch of quaint charm to the scene. On the left side of the street, there's a building with a green roof, its color blending harmoniously with the surrounding nature. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it, adding to the overall tranquility of the scene. The image beautifully encapsulates the blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
