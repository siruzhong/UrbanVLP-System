The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the blue sky dotted with white clouds. On the right side of the street, there are buildings visible, their details slightly obscured by the distance. The colors in the image are predominantly green from the trees, blue from the sky, and gray from the buildings. The overall effect is a harmonious blend of urban and natural elements."}
