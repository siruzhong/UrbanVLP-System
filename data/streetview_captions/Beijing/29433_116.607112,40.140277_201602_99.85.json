The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. Power lines crisscross above, adding a touch of urbanity to the otherwise natural landscape. In the distance, buildings rise, their architecture hinting at the blend of traditional and modern styles that characterize Beijing. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene and highlighting the textures of the trees and buildings. Despite the bustling cityscape, there's a sense of tranquility that pervades the image, perhaps due to the absence of people or the harmonious coexistence of nature within the urban environment."}
