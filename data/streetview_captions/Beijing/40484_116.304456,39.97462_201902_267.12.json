The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly white and gray, punctuated by occasional blue and green accents that add a touch of color to the urban landscape. The street itself is a hive of activity, with cars and buses navigating their way through the city's arteries. On either side of the street, trees stand tall, providing a touch of nature amidst the concrete jungle. The sky above is a clear blue, suggesting a bright and sunny day."}
