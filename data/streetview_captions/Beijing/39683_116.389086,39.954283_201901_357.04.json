The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of the towering buildings that line the street. The buildings, painted in shades of white and gray, rise high into the clear blue sky, their windows reflecting the sunlight. The street itself is a hive of activity, with cars and buses moving along its length, adding a dynamic element to the scene. On the right side of the street, trees and bushes provide a touch of greenery, contrasting with the urban landscape. The image is bathed in the warm glow of the sun, casting long shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings."}
