The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the surroundings. The street is lined with lush green trees and bushes, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. Power lines crisscross above, forming an intricate web against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow on the scene and creating a lens flare that adds a touch of magic to the image. The colors are vibrant and full of life, with the green of the trees contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky. This is a typical day in Beijing, where nature and urban life coexist in harmony."}
