The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of the towering buildings that line the street. These structures, predominantly white and gray, rise high into the clear blue sky, punctuated by the radiant sun in the center. The street itself is a hive of activity, with cars and buses moving along its length, adding a dynamic element to the scene. On the right side of the street, a few trees and lampposts can be seen, providing a touch of nature amidst the urban landscape."}
