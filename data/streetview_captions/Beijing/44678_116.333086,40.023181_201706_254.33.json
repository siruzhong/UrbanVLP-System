The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the surroundings. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves rustling in the unseen breeze, casting dappled shadows on the pavement. A white van is parked on the side of the road, adding a touch of urban life to the otherwise tranquil setting. In the distance, tall apartment buildings rise, their windows reflecting the bright sunlight. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting long shadows and illuminating the scene with a warm glow. The image is a beautiful blend of nature and urban life, showcasing the harmonious coexistence of the two in Beijing."}
