The street is lined with lush green trees on both sides, creating a canopy of greenery. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene. The perspective of the image is from the middle of the street, looking down its length, giving a sense of depth and continuity. In the distance, buildings can be seen, adding an urban touch to the otherwise natural landscape. The image does not contain any text or specific actions being performed by objects. The relative positions of the objects remain constant, with the trees lining the street and the buildings standing tall in the background. The image does not provide enough detail to confidently count the number of trees or buildings. The colors in the image are predominantly green from the trees, blue from the sky, and brown from the buildings. The image does not contain any imaginary content. All descriptions are based on the visible content of the image."}
