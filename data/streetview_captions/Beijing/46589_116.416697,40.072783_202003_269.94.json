The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly white and gray, punctuated by occasional red and green accents that add a touch of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene. The street itself is lined with lush green trees and bushes, providing a stark contrast to the urban architecture. Cars and buses can be seen in motion on the road, adding a dynamic element to the scene."}
