The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The sky is a clear blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds, and the sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The street itself is lined with lush green trees and bushes, adding a touch of nature to the urban landscape. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city. Overhead, power lines crisscross the sky, a common sight in many urban areas."}
