The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves forming a natural canopy overhead. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city. Cars parked along the side of the road add a touch of modern life to the scene. The sky above is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the entire scene."}
