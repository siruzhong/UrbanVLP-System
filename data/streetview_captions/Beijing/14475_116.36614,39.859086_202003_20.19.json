The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly white and yellow, punctuated by occasional red and green accents. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun casting a bright light that illuminates the scene. The street below is a hive of activity, filled with cars and pedestrians going about their day. In the distance, a pedestrian bridge can be seen, adding another layer of depth to the image."}
