The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene and creating a lens flare effect in the image. In the distance, a few cars can be seen driving down the road, adding a touch of life to the otherwise serene landscape. The image beautifully encapsulates the blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
