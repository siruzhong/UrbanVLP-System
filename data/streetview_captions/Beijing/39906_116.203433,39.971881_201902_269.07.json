The perspective is from a high angle, providing a bird's eye view of the scene. The street is flanked by buildings on both sides, their facades bathed in the warm glow of the sun. Red lanterns hang from the lampposts, swaying gently in the breeze, adding a touch of color and tradition to the urban landscape. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting long shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings. In the distance, mountains rise against the horizon, their majestic peaks adding a sense of depth and scale to the scene. The image beautifully encapsulates the blend of tradition and modernity that characterizes Beijing."}
