The street, bathed in the soft glow of daylight, is flanked by lush green trees on both sides, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it, adding to the overall tranquility of the scene. The perspective of the image is from the middle of the street, looking down its length, giving a sense of depth and continuity. The colors in the image are vibrant and natural, with the green of the trees contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky."}
