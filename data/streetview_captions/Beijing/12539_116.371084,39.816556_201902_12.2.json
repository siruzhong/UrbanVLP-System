The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves forming a natural canopy overhead. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it, adding depth to the background. The image is slightly distorted due to the fisheye lens effect, which gives it a unique, almost surreal quality."}
