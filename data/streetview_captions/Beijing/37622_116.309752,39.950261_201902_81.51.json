The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with buildings on both sides, their red and white facades standing out against the blue sky. The buildings are adorned with balconies and awnings, adding character to the cityscape. In the center of the image, a roundabout with a red and white dome draws the eye, surrounded by trees that add a touch of green to the urban environment. On the right side of the image, a blue sign with white text stands out, although the text is not visible in the image. The overall scene is a blend of urban architecture and natural elements, creating a harmonious balance."}
