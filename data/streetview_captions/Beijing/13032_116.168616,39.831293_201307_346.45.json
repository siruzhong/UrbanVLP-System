The perspective is from the middle of the street, looking towards the horizon. The sky above is a clear blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds. The street itself is lined with lush green trees, their leaves rustling in the breeze. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades bathed in the soft glow of the daylight. Power lines crisscross above, forming a web-like pattern against the sky. The image is captured from a low angle, making the viewer feel as if they are standing right there on the street, looking up at the buildings and the sky."}
