The trees, standing tall on both sides of the street, are adorned with lush green leaves, creating a canopy that filters the sunlight and casts dappled shadows on the ground. \n\nThe street itself is paved with asphalt, its dark surface contrasting with the vibrant greenery. It's a quiet street, devoid of any vehicles or pedestrians, adding to the serene atmosphere. \n\nOn the right side of the street, there's a fence running parallel to it. Beyond the fence, you can see a field of crops, their golden hues peeking through the foliage of the trees. \n\nThe sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered here and there, adding depth to the expansive sky. \n\nThe image is captured from a low angle, giving a sense of looking up at the towering trees and the expansive sky. The perspective also emphasizes the height of the trees and the vastness of the sky. \n\nOverall, the image captures a peaceful moment on a tree-lined street, surrounded by nature, under a clear blue sky."}
