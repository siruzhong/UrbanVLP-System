The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the blue sky. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene and highlighting the details of the buildings and trees.
