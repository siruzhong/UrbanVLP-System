The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly white and gray, punctuated by occasional blue and green accents that add a touch of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene. The street itself is lined with trees and lampposts, adding a sense of order and symmetry to the urban landscape. A few people can be seen walking on the sidewalk, going about their day, adding a touch of life to the scene."}
