The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of a clear blue sky. The buildings in the background, painted in shades of red and orange, add a warm hue to the overall composition. The image is captured using a fisheye lens, which distorts the edges of the frame, creating an interesting visual effect."}
