The street is flanked by a row of trees on the left, their leaves a vibrant green. On the right, power lines stretch across the scene, following the curve of the street. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The perspective of the image is from the middle of the street, looking down its length, giving a sense of depth and continuity. The image does not contain any text or discernible actions by objects. The relative positions of the objects remain constant, with the trees lining the left side of the street and the power lines running parallel to the right side. The image does not provide enough detail to confidently count the number of trees or power lines. The colors in the image are predominantly green (the trees), blue (the sky), and gray (the road)."}
