The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees and shrubs on both sides, their lush greenery contrasting with the clear blue sky above. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The street itself is paved with asphalt, and a sidewalk runs parallel to it, inviting pedestrians for a leisurely stroll. The image does not contain any text or discernible actions. The relative positions of the objects suggest a well-planned urban layout, with the trees and shrubs neatly lining the street, and the sidewalk running parallel to it. The image does not provide enough detail to confidently count the number of trees or shrubs. The colors in the image are predominantly green from the trees and shrubs, blue from the sky, and gray from the asphalt of the street. The image does not contain any imaginary content. All descriptions are based on the visible content of the image."}
