The street, bathed in the warm glow of the sun, is flanked by trees on both sides, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting long shadows on the ground. The perspective of the image is from a low angle, giving a sense of depth and dimension to the scene. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the green of the trees contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky. The image does not contain any text or discernible actions. The relative positions of the objects suggest a well-maintained urban landscape, with the trees neatly lining the street and the buildings standing tall in the background. The image is a testament to the harmonious coexistence of nature and urban development in Beijing."}
