The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with buildings and trees, creating a harmonious blend of urban and natural elements. The buildings, painted in shades of red and white, stand out against the blue sky. The trees, with their bare branches, suggest that the photo was taken during the winter or early spring. The sun casts a bright light, illuminating the scene and creating a lens flare in the top left corner of the image. The overall composition of the image provides a glimpse into the architectural style and natural beauty of Beijing."}
