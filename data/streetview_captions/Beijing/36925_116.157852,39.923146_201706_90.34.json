The highway, divided by a concrete barrier, stretches out ahead, leading the eye towards the city skyline. The skyline is a mix of tall buildings and construction cranes, indicating a city in the throes of development. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it. The image is taken from a low angle, which emphasizes the height of the buildings and gives a sense of depth to the scene. The colors in the image are mostly neutral, with the blue of the sky providing a striking contrast. The image does not provide enough information to confidently identify the specific worldwide landmark."}
