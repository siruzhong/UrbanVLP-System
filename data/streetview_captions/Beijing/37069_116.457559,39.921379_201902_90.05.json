The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of the towering buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly white and gray, punctuated by occasional red and green accents that add a touch of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. \n\nThe street itself is a hive of activity, filled with cars and pedestrians going about their day. Overhead, power lines crisscross the sky, a common sight in many urban landscapes. The sky above is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the scene."}
