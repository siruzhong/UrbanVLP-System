The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves forming a canopy overhead. Cars are parked neatly on the side of the road, adding a touch of urban life to the otherwise serene setting. The sky above is a clear blue, providing a beautiful contrast to the greenery below. The image is slightly distorted due to the fisheye lens effect, adding a unique perspective to the photograph."}
