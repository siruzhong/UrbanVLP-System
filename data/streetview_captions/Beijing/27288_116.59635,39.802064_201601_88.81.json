The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. A car is seen driving down the street, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static scene. On the right side of the street, there's a building with a white facade, standing tall amidst the greenery. The sun is shining brightly, casting shadows and highlighting the details of the scene. The image is a beautiful representation of urban life in Beijing, with its blend of nature and architecture."}
