The sky above is a clear blue, adding a vibrant contrast to the greenery below. The image is taken from a low angle, giving a sense of depth and perspective to the scene. The colors in the image are predominantly green and blue, with the green of the trees and the blue of the sky creating a harmonious palette. The image does not contain any text or discernible actions. The relative positions of the trees suggest a well-maintained urban landscape, with the trees evenly spaced along the length of the street. The image does not provide enough detail to confidently count the number of trees or identify specific types of trees. Overall, the image provides a tranquil snapshot of a typical day on a tree-lined street in Beijing."}
