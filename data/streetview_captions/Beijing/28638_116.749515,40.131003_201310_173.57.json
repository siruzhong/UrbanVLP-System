The street, bathed in the warm glow of the sun, is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting long shadows on the ground. The perspective of the image is from a low angle, looking up towards the towering trees and the expansive sky, creating a sense of depth and scale. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the green of the trees contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky."}
