The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with buildings and trees, creating a harmonious blend of urban and natural elements. The buildings, painted in shades of white and gray, stand tall against the backdrop of a clear blue sky. The trees, on the other hand, add a touch of green to the otherwise monochrome palette. The sun shines brightly in the sky, casting a warm glow over the entire scene."}
