The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the scene. The sky is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly in the top left corner, casting a warm glow over the entire scene.\n\nOn the right side of the street, there's a building with a green roof, nestled amidst lush green trees and bushes, adding a touch of nature to the urban landscape. On the left side, a red traffic light stands tall, a common sight in bustling city streets, providing a stark contrast to the surrounding greenery.\n\nThe street itself is lined with power lines, a testament to the city's infrastructure, and a sidewalk runs parallel to it, inviting pedestrians for a leisurely stroll. The image beautifully encapsulates the blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
