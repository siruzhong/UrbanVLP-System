The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is flanked by buildings on both sides, their architecture hinting at the urban landscape of the city. A few cars and buses can be seen in the distance, adding a touch of movement to the otherwise still scene. The sky above is hazy, casting a soft light over the entire scene. The colors in the image are muted, with shades of gray and green dominating the palette, reflecting the overcast weather conditions."}
