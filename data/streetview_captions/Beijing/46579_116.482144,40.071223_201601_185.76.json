The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with power lines and telephone poles, a common sight in many urban areas. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades bathed in the soft light of what appears to be a clear day. The sky above is a hazy blue, adding a serene backdrop to the bustling cityscape below."}
