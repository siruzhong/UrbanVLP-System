The perspective is from a pedestrian's viewpoint on the sidewalk, immersing the viewer in the city's daily life. The street is lined with a variety of buildings, their facades painted in a palette of mostly beige and white, punctuated by occasional splashes of red and green. \n\nVehicles, including cars and buses, traverse the road, adding a dynamic element to the scene. The sky above is a clear blue, providing a stark contrast to the urban landscape below.
