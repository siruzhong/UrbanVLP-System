The highway, filled with cars, stretches out in front of us, leading our eyes towards the towering buildings that rise in the distance. These structures, predominantly white and gray, are punctuated by occasional blue and green accents, adding a touch of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. The sky above is a clear blue, providing a stark contrast to the urban landscape below. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene and illuminating the city in a soft light."}
