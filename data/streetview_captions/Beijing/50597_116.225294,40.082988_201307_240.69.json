These buildings are nestled amidst lush greenery, with trees and shrubs adding a touch of nature to the urban setting.\n\nPower lines crisscross above the street, creating a network of lines against the sky. On the right side of the photo, a person can be seen walking on the sidewalk, adding a touch of life to the scene. The image beautifully encapsulates the blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
