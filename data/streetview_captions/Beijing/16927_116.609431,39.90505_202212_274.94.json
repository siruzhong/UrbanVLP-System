The perspective is from a car on the road, providing a driver's eye view of the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. The buildings, mostly white and gray, rise majestically in the background, their facades bathed in the warm glow of the sun. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting long shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings. The image is slightly distorted due to the fisheye lens effect, adding a unique perspective to the scene."}
