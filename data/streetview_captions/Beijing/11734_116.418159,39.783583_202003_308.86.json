The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly white and gray, punctuated by occasional red and orange accents that add a splash of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. The sky above is a clear blue, providing a stark contrast to the urban landscape below. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings."}
