The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of the towering buildings that line the street. These structures, predominantly gray and white, rise high into the hazy blue sky, punctuated by a smattering of clouds. The street itself is a hive of activity, with cars and buses moving along its length, adding a dynamic element to the scene. On the right side of the street, construction cranes can be seen, hinting at the ongoing development and growth of the city."}
