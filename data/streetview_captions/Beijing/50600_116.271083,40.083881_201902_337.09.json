The perspective is from the middle of the street, looking down its length. On either side of the street, there are bare trees standing tall, their branches reaching out towards the clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow on the scene. In the distance, a few buildings can be seen, their details softened by the distance. The street itself is lined with a sidewalk, and a fence runs parallel to it on the right side. The colors in the image are predominantly blue, green, and brown, creating a serene and peaceful atmosphere."}
