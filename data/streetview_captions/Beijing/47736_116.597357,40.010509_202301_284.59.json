The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of looking up towards the sky. The street is flanked by trees on both sides, their bare branches reaching out into the clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene. A white car is parked on the right side of the street, adding a touch of modern life to the otherwise tranquil setting. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the blue of the sky contrasting beautifully with the green of the trees and the white of the car."}
