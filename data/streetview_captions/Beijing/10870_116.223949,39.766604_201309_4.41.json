The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of the city's towering structures. The sky above is a clear blue, providing a stark contrast to the urban landscape below. Buildings of various sizes and designs line the street, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city. Power lines crisscross above, a common sight in many urban areas.
