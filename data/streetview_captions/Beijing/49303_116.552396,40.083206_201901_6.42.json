The perspective is from a car on the road, providing a driver's eye view of the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the clear blue sky. A few cars can be seen driving down the road, adding a sense of movement to the otherwise still scene. In the distance, a large white building with a curved roof stands out, its modern architecture contrasting with the natural elements of the street. The sun shines brightly overhead, casting long shadows and highlighting the textures of the trees and building. The image is a blend of urban and natural elements, creating a harmonious balance."}
