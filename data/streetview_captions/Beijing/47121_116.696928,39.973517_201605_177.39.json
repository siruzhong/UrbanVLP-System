The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves forming a canopy that filters the sunlight, casting dappled shadows on the road below. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, illuminating the scene with a warm glow. In the distance, buildings can be seen, their details softened by the distance and the foliage. The image appears to have been captured using a fisheye lens, which adds a unique distortion to the edges of the frame, enhancing the panoramic effect."}
