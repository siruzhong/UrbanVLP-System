The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees and bushes, adding a touch of nature to the urban landscape. A large concrete overpass stretches across the street, its curved shape contrasting with the straight lines of the road. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting shadows and highlighting the details of the scene."}
