The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the image. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves forming a canopy that filters the sunlight, casting dappled shadows on the ground. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades bathed in the warm glow of the sun. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, illuminating the scene with a vibrant light."}
