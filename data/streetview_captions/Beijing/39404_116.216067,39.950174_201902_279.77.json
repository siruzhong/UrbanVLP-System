The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with white buildings, their red roofs adding a pop of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. Overhead, power lines crisscross against the backdrop of a clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene. In the distance, trees can be seen, adding a touch of nature to the urban landscape."}
