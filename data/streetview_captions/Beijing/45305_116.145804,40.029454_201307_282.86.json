The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the image. The street is lined with lush green trees and shrubs, their leaves a vibrant green that contrasts beautifully with the clear blue sky above. The road, made of dirt, winds its way through the trees, disappearing into the distance. On the right side of the road, a sidewalk runs parallel, inviting passersby to take a leisurely stroll. The image is bathed in the soft light of day, highlighting the natural beauty of this urban landscape."}
