The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is flanked by buildings on both sides, their facades bathed in the warm glow of the sun. Cars and buses traverse the road, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static urban landscape. The sky above is a clear blue, providing a striking contrast to the earthy tones of the buildings. In the distance, trees can be seen, their green foliage adding a touch of nature to the urban setting."}
