The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly white and gray, punctuated by occasional red and orange accents that add a splash of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. The street itself is a hive of activity, filled with cars and buses navigating their way through the city's arteries. On either side of the street, trees provide a touch of nature amidst the urban landscape. The sky overhead is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the scene."}
