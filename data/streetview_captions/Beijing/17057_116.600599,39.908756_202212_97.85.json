The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is flanked by buildings on both sides, their facades adorned with scaffolding, hinting at ongoing construction or renovation work. The sky above is a clear blue, providing a stark contrast to the urban landscape below. Power lines crisscross above the street, connecting the buildings and adding a touch of complexity to the scene. The sun shines brightly, casting shadows and illuminating the scene with a warm glow."}
