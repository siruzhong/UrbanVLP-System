The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves forming a canopy that filters the sunlight, casting dappled shadows on the road below. The sky above is a clear blue, adding a vibrant contrast to the greenery below. The image appears to be captured using a fisheye lens, which distorts the edges of the frame, enhancing the circular perspective."}
