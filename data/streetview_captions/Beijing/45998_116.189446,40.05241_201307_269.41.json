The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. Power lines stretch across the scene, following the curve of the street. On the right side of the street, a car is parked, adding a touch of everyday life to the scene. The image is bathed in the warm glow of the sun, casting long shadows and highlighting the textures of the trees and power lines. The overall effect is a harmonious blend of urban and natural elements, a characteristic feature of Beijing's cityscape."}
