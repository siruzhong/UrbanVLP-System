The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves rustling in the unseen breeze, casting dappled shadows on the red brick buildings that flank the road. The buildings, with their traditional architecture, add a touch of history and culture to the scene. The sky above is a clear blue, with a smattering of clouds adding depth to the vast expanse. The image is bathed in the soft light of day, highlighting the colors and details of the scene."}
