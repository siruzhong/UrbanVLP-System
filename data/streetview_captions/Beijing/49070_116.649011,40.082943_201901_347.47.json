The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves forming a natural canopy overhead. Street lamps stand sentinel along the road, ready to bathe the scene in a warm glow as dusk falls. Cars are parked neatly on the side of the road, their metallic bodies gleaming under the soft light. Buildings rise in the background, their windows reflecting the world around them. The sky above is a clear blue, with a smattering of clouds adding depth to the expansive canvas."}
