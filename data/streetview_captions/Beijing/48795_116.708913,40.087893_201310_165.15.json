The street, curving gently to the right, is flanked by lush green trees on both sides, creating a natural canopy overhead. A white car is captured in motion on the left side of the street, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise serene setting. The sky above is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the scene. The image is taken from a low angle, which emphasizes the height of the trees and gives a sense of being immersed in the scene. The colors in the image are predominantly green and gray, reflecting the natural and urban elements of the landscape."}
