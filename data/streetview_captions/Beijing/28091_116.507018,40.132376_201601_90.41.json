The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. Street lamps stand sentinel along the road, their presence hinting at the transformation of the scene as day turns to night. The sun shines brightly in the top right corner of the image, casting long shadows and illuminating the scene with a warm glow. The image is a blend of urban and natural elements, creating a harmonious balance."}
