The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees and buildings, creating a harmonious blend of nature and architecture. The buildings are tall and modern, their glass facades reflecting the light, while the trees add a touch of green to the urban landscape. Overhead, power lines crisscross the sky, a common sight in many cities. The sky itself is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the scene."}
