The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. A car can be seen driving down the street, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static landscape. The image is a beautiful representation of urban life in Beijing, with its blend of natural and man-made elements."}
