The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of looking up at the towering buildings and the clear blue sky. The buildings, painted in hues of white and beige, rise majestically, their windows reflecting the sunlight. The street below is a hive of activity, with cars and buses moving along the road, adding a dynamic element to the scene. On the right side of the street, trees and bushes provide a touch of greenery, contrasting with the urban landscape. The image is bathed in the warm glow of a sunny day, casting long shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings."}
