The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees and bushes, adding a touch of nature to the urban landscape. Lampposts stand tall on the sides of the street, ready to illuminate the area as dusk falls. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene."}
