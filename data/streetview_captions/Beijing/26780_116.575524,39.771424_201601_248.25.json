The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the image. The trees, standing tall on both sides of the street, are bare, their branches reaching out towards the clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly through the trees, casting a warm glow on the scene. In the distance, a building can be seen, adding a touch of urbanity to the otherwise natural landscape. The image is bathed in the light of day, highlighting the colors and details of the scene."}
