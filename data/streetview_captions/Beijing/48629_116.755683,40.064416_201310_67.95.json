The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. Cars are parked along the side of the road, adding a touch of urban life to the otherwise serene setting.
