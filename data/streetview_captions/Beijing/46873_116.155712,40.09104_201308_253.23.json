The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees on both sides, their leaves rustling in the unseen breeze. Power lines crisscross above, forming a network against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades bathed in sunlight. The sun shines brightly in the top right corner of the image, casting long shadows and illuminating the scene with a warm glow."}
