The perspective is from the middle of the street, looking towards the horizon. The sky above is a clear blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds. On either side of the street, lush green trees stand tall, their leaves rustling in the breeze. The street itself is devoid of any vehicles or pedestrians, giving it a serene and peaceful ambiance. The sun shines brightly overhead, casting a warm glow on the scene. The image does not contain any discernible text. The relative positions of the objects suggest a well-planned urban layout, with the trees neatly lining the street and the buildings maintaining a respectful distance. The image does not provide enough detail to confidently count the number of trees or buildings. The colors in the image are predominantly green from the trees, blue from the sky, and gray from the street and buildings. The image does not contain any imaginary content; everything described can be confidently determined from the image itself. The image does not contain any aesthetic descriptions."}
