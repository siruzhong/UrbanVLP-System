The perspective is from a high angle, providing a bird's eye view of the scene. The street, lined with trees on both sides, stretches out into the distance, flanked by power lines that crisscross above. The sky above is a clear blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds. The predominant colors in the image are green from the trees and blue from the sky, creating a serene and tranquil atmosphere. The image does not contain any discernible text or countable objects. The relative positions of the objects suggest a well-planned urban layout, with the trees providing a natural canopy over the street."}
