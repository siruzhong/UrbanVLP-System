The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is flanked by buildings on both sides, their facades bathed in the warm glow of the sun. Power lines crisscross above, adding a touch of urbanity to the scene. In the distance, a bridge stretches across the street, connecting two parts of the city. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting long shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings."}
