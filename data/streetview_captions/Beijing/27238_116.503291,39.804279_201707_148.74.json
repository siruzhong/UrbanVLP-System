The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the buildings that line the street. The buildings, painted in shades of white and gray, rise high into the hazy blue sky, their windows reflecting the sunlight. \n\nThe street itself is a hive of activity with cars and buses moving along it, their colors muted under the overcast sky. On either side of the street, trees and bushes add a touch of green to the urban landscape, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. \n\nThe image is bathed in the soft light of day, casting long shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings. Despite the overcast sky, the scene is vibrant and full of life, a snapshot of everyday life in one of the world's most populated cities."}
