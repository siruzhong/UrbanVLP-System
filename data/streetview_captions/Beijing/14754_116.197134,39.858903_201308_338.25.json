The vantage point is high, providing a bird's eye view of the scene below. The street, divided by a median, stretches out into the distance, flanked by buildings on both sides. Overhead, a network of power lines crisscrosses the sky, while street lamps stand sentinel along the sidewalks. The sky above is a clear blue, and the sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene. The image is taken from a low angle, adding a sense of depth and perspective to the view."}
