The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of a clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow on the scene and creating a lens flare in the top left corner of the image. In the distance, buildings can be seen, adding an urban touch to the otherwise natural landscape.
