The perspective is from a car on the road, giving a driver's eye view of the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the cityscape. Buildings rise in the distance, their facades a mix of modern and traditional architecture, reflecting the blend of old and new that characterizes Beijing. The sky above is a clear blue, and the sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene. The image is slightly distorted due to the fisheye lens effect, adding a unique perspective to the view."}
