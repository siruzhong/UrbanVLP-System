The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves forming a natural canopy overhead. Cars are parked neatly along the sides of the street, adding a touch of urban life to the scene. Buildings rise in the background, their facades bathed in sunlight. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene."}
