The perspective is from the middle of the street, looking towards the horizon. The street is lined with lush green trees on both sides, creating a canopy of leaves overhead. The sky above is a clear blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds. \n\nOn the right side of the street, there's a blue sign with white Chinese characters, possibly indicating a street name or direction. On the left side, there's a white building with a green roof, standing out against the blue sky. The building's architecture suggests it could be a residential or commercial structure. \n\nThe image does not contain any discernible text. The relative positions of the objects suggest a quiet, possibly early morning or late afternoon, time of day. The street is devoid of people and cars, adding to the serene atmosphere of the scene. The image captures the essence of a typical day in Beijing, with its blend of natural and man-made elements."}
