The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is flanked by buildings on both sides, their facades adorned with red banners that add a vibrant splash of color to the urban landscape. The sky above is a clear blue, with wispy clouds scattered across it. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene."}
