The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves rustling in the breeze, casting dappled shadows on the pavement. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades bathed in the warm glow of the sun. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, its rays filtering through the leaves of the trees, creating a kaleidoscope of light and shadow on the ground. The image captures the essence of a typical day in Beijing, with its blend of natural beauty and architectural charm."}
