From the vantage point of a car on the road, the viewer's gaze is directed upwards towards a large concrete overpass. The overpass, supported by two sturdy pillars, arches gracefully over the street, creating a tunnel-like effect. A yellow and black striped divider runs down the center of the road, guiding the flow of traffic under the overpass. The sky above is a clear blue, providing a striking contrast to the urban landscape below. In the distance, buildings and power lines can be seen, adding depth and context to the scene. The image is a blend of urban architecture and natural elements, offering a glimpse into the daily life in Beijing."}
