The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is flanked by buildings on both sides, their architecture hinting at the urban landscape of the city. Overhead, a network of power lines crisscrosses the sky, a common sight in many cities. In the distance, a bridge stretches across the scene, connecting two parts of the city. The sky above is a clear blue, with a smattering of clouds adding depth to the background."}
