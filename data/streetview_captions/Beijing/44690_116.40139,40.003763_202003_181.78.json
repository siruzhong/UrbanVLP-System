The sun, high in the sky, casts a bright light that illuminates the scene. The street is lined with trees, their leaves a vibrant green, providing a stark contrast to the urban landscape. Buildings of various heights and designs flank the street, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city. Cars, parked and in motion, add a dynamic element to the scene. The image is taken from a low angle, giving a sense of looking up at the towering buildings and the expansive sky. The perspective is panoramic, offering a wide view of the cityscape."}
