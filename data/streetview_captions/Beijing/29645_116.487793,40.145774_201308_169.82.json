The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves forming a canopy overhead. The buildings on the right side of the street are made of brick, their red and brown hues contrasting with the green of the trees. On the left side of the street, there's a yellow wall, adding a pop of color to the scene. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting light and shadows that add depth to the image."}
