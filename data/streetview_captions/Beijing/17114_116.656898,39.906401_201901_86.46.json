The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly white and gray, punctuated by colorful signs and advertisements that add a vibrant touch to the otherwise monochrome palette. \n\nThe street itself is a hive of activity, with cars and pedestrians adding life to the scene. The sidewalks are lined with trees, providing a touch of greenery amidst the urban landscape. Overhead, power lines crisscross the sky, a common sight in many cityscapes."}
