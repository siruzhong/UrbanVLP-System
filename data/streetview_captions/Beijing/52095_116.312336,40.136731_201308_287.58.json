The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. A white car is parked on the side of the road, adding a touch of modernity to the otherwise tranquil setting. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun casting its warm glow on the scene. The image beautifully encapsulates the blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
