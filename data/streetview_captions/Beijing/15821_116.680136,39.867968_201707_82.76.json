The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of the towering structures that are being erected. The buildings, painted in hues of red and brown, rise high into the overcast sky, their facades adorned with intricate designs that hint at the architectural style of the area. The ground is a patchwork of dirt and construction materials, a testament to the ongoing development. A few pedestrians can be seen strolling along the sidewalk, adding a touch of everyday life to the scene. Despite the absence of vibrant colors, the image paints a vivid picture of a city in progress, constantly evolving and growing."}
