The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the image. The trees, with their lush green leaves, stand tall on both sides of the street, creating a natural canopy overhead. A blue fence runs along the right side of the street, adding a pop of color to the scene. In the distance, a building with a red roof peeks through the foliage, hinting at the urban life beyond the tranquility of the street. The image is slightly distorted due to the fisheye lens effect, adding an artistic touch to this everyday scene."}
