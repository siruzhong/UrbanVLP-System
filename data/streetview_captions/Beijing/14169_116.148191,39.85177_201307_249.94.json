The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with tall trees on both sides, their green leaves contrasting with the blue sky dotted with white clouds. The road itself is unpaved, adding a rustic charm to the scene. On the right side of the road, there's a pile of rubble, perhaps remnants of a nearby construction or renovation project. The image beautifully captures the blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
