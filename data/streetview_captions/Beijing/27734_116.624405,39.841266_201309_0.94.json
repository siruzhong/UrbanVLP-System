The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, which is a clear blue with wispy white clouds. The street itself is lined with lush green trees and bushes, adding a touch of nature to the urban setting. Power lines stretch across the scene, a common sight in many cities. In the distance, buildings rise, their details softened by the distance. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene."}
