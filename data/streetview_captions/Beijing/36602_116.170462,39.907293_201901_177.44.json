The street, lined with towering buildings and lush green trees, stretches out into the distance, creating a sense of depth and perspective. The buildings, predominantly white and gray, rise high into the clear blue sky, their windows reflecting the sunlight. The trees, a mix of green and brown, add a touch of nature to the urban landscape. The sun shines brightly in the background, casting long shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings. The image is taken from a low angle, which emphasizes the height of the buildings and the vastness of the sky. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the blue of the sky contrasting beautifully with the green of the trees and the gray and white of the buildings. The image does not contain any text or specific actions being performed by objects. The relative positions of the objects suggest a well-planned urban layout, with buildings and trees neatly arranged along the street. The image does not provide enough detail to confidently count the number of objects or identify specific types of objects beyond those described. The image does not contain any imaginary content; everything described can be confidently determined from the image itself. The image does not contain any aesthetic descriptions."}
