The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The sky is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it, suggesting a bright and sunny day.\n\nOn either side of the street, there are bare trees standing tall, their branches reaching out towards the sky. The trees are devoid of leaves, indicating that it might be late autumn or winter. \n\nThe street itself is lined with power lines running parallel to it, a common sight in many urban areas. On the right side of the street, there's a building under construction, its skeletal structure covered in scaffolding. This suggests ongoing development and growth in the area.\n\nOn the left side of the street, there's a green fence running along the length of the building. The fence is adorned with circular decorations, adding a touch of color and visual interest to the otherwise plain fence.\n\nOverall, the image presents a typical day in a bustling city like Beijing, with its mix of natural and man-made elements coexisting side by side."}
