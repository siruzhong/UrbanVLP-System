The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves forming a canopy overhead. The sky above is a clear blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds. On either side of the street, buildings rise, their architecture hinting at the blend of traditional and modern styles that characterize Beijing. The colors in the image are predominantly green from the trees, blue from the sky, and gray from the buildings, creating a harmonious palette that is pleasing to the eye."}
