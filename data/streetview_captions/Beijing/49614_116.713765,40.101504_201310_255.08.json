The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees and bushes, adding a touch of nature to the urban landscape. Power lines stretch across the sky, a common sight in many cities. A tall power line tower stands prominently in the background, a testament to the city's infrastructure. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene."}
