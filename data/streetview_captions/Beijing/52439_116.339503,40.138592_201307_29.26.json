The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees on both sides, their leaves forming a canopy overhead. A white car is parked on the right side of the street, adding a touch of modernity to the otherwise tranquil setting. On the left side of the street, there's a small building with a red roof, its vibrant color contrasting with the greenery around it. The sky above is a clear blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds, completing the picturesque scene."}
