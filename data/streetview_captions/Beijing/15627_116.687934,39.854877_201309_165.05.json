The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the scene. The trees, with their lush green leaves, line both sides of the street, creating a natural canopy overhead. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene."}
