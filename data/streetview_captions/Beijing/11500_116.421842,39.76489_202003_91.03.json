The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. A few clouds are scattered across the sky, adding depth to the image. On the left side of the street, there's a blue fence running parallel to the road, adding a pop of color to the scene. On the right side, a metal bridge arches over the street, its design simple yet elegant. The sun shines brightly, casting shadows and highlighting the details of the scene. The image beautifully encapsulates a typical day in Beijing, with its blend of natural beauty and architectural charm."}
