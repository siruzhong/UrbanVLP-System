The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly white and gray, punctuated by occasional blue and green accents that add a touch of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene. The street itself is lined with trees and lampposts, adding a sense of order and symmetry to the urban landscape. Despite the absence of people in the frame, the image conveys a sense of life and activity, characteristic of a busy city street."}
