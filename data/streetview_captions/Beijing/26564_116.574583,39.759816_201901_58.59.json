The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of the towering buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly white and gray, punctuated by occasional blue and green accents, reflecting the urban landscape of the city. The street itself is a hive of activity, filled with cars and buses navigating their way through the city's arteries.
