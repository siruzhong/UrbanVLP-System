The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees and buildings, creating a canopy of greenery and architecture. The buildings, predominantly white and gray, are punctuated with occasional red and green accents, adding a splash of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. The sky above is a clear blue, providing a stark contrast to the urban landscape below."}
