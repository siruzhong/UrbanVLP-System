The perspective is from a high angle, providing a bird's eye view of the scene. The trees, stripped of their leaves, stand tall on both sides of the street, their bare branches reaching out towards the clear blue sky. The street itself is devoid of any vehicles or pedestrians, adding a sense of tranquility to the scene. In the distance, a few buildings can be seen, their presence subtly hinting at the urban environment surrounding this serene street."}
