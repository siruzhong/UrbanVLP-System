These structures tower over the street, creating a sense of scale and grandeur. Amidst the concrete jungle, patches of greenery peek through, adding a touch of nature to the urban setting.\n\nThe street itself is a hive of activity. Cars and buses fill the road, their metallic bodies gleaming under the sunlight.
