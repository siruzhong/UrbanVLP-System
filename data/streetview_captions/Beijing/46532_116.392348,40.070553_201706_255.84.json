The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. Power lines crisscross above, adding a touch of urbanity to the otherwise natural landscape. In the distance, buildings rise, their presence subtly hinted at by the slight blur of the image. The overall color palette is dominated by shades of green and blue, reflecting the natural and man-made elements of the scene."}
