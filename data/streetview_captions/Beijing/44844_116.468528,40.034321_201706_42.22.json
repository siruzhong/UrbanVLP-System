The toll booth, a large structure with a yellow roof and a gray facade, stands prominently in the center of the frame. It's surrounded by a multitude of cars, their colors a mix of white, black, and red, all paused in their journey as they wait their turn to pass through the toll booth. The sky above is a clear blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds, providing a stark contrast to the urban landscape below. The perspective of the image is from the road, looking towards the toll booth, giving a sense of being in the midst of the traffic."}
