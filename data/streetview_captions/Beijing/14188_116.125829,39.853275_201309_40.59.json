The perspective is from a car on the highway, giving a driver's eye view of the scene. The highway itself is a six-lane divided highway, with three lanes designated for each direction of traffic. \n\nOn either side of the highway, there are lush green trees and bushes, providing a stark contrast to the urban landscape. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene. \n\nIn the distance, the majestic Great Wall of China can be seen, winding its way through the landscape. The wall, a symbol of China's rich history and cultural heritage, adds a unique element to the otherwise modern highway scene. \n\nThe image is a blend of the old and the new, the natural and the man-made, creating a harmonious balance that is characteristic of Beijing. It's a snapshot of a moment in time in this vibrant city, where history and modernity coexist."}
