The perspective is from a pedestrian's viewpoint on the sidewalk, immersing the viewer in the city's daily life. The street is flanked by buildings on both sides, their facades painted in a palette of mostly white and gray, punctuated by occasional splashes of red and blue. \n\nVehicles, including cars and buses, traverse the road, adding a dynamic element to the scene. Overhead, the sky is a clear blue, providing a stark contrast to the urban landscape below. In the distance, a large construction site stands out, hinting at the city's continuous growth and development."}
