The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of depth and scale to the scene. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. On either side of the street, lush green trees stand tall, their leaves rustling in the unseen breeze. Power lines crisscross above, forming a network of lines against the sky. Buildings of various sizes and designs line the street, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city. A white van is parked on the right side of the street, adding a touch of modernity to the otherwise timeless scene. The image is bathed in the soft light of day, highlighting the vibrant colors and intricate details of the urban landscape."}
