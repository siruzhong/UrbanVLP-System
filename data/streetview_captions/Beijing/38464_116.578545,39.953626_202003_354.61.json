The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with buildings on both sides, their facades bathed in the warm glow of the sun. Trees and bushes add a touch of greenery to the urban landscape, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze.
