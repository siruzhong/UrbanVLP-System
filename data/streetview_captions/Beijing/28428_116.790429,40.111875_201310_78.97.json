The perspective is from a low angle, giving the viewer a sense of looking up at the towering trees and the clear blue sky above. The trees, with their lush green leaves, stand tall on both sides of the street, creating a natural canopy overhead. The road, made of asphalt, stretches out in front of the viewer, inviting them to take a leisurely stroll down this picturesque street. The image is bathed in the warm glow of daylight, adding to the overall tranquility of the scene."}
