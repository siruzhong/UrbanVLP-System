The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the buildings that line the street. These buildings, modern in design, are constructed of concrete and glass, reflecting the sunlight and adding a touch of brightness to the scene. The street itself is lined with trees and lampposts, providing a sense of order and symmetry. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings."}
