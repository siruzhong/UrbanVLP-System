The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves forming a natural canopy overhead. Street lamps stand sentinel along the sidewalk, their presence suggesting a warm glow that would light up the street come nightfall. Cars are parked neatly on the side of the road, their metallic bodies gleaming under the sunlight. The sky above is a clear blue, with a smattering of clouds adding depth to the vast expanse."}
