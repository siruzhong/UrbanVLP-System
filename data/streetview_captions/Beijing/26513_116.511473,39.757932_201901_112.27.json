The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees and buildings, creating a harmonious blend of nature and architecture. A red car is parked on the side of the road, adding a pop of color to the otherwise muted palette of the image. The sky above is hazy, casting a soft light over the scene. The image is bathed in the warm glow of daylight, highlighting the details of the buildings and trees."}
