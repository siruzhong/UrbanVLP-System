The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with buildings on both sides, their facades bathed in the warm glow of the sun. Bare trees stand tall, their branches reaching out towards the sky, adding a touch of nature to the urban landscape. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting long shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings. The image is a blend of urban architecture and natural elements, creating a harmonious balance between man-made structures and nature."}
