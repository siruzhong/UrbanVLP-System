The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees and bushes, adding a touch of nature to the urban landscape. Power lines stretch across the sky, a common sight in many cities. On the right side of the street, there's a tall metal tower, possibly a telecommunications or electricity pylon, standing as a testament to modern infrastructure. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun casting a bright light that illuminates the scene."}
