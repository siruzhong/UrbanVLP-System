The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves forming a canopy overhead. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades bathed in sunlight. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it. The image is slightly distorted due to the fisheye lens effect, adding a unique perspective to the scene."}
