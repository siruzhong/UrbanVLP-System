The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with power lines that crisscross above, creating a network of lines against the sky. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades bathed in sunlight. Cars are parked along the side of the road, adding a touch of everyday life to the scene. The sky above is a clear blue, with a smattering of clouds visible in the distance."}
