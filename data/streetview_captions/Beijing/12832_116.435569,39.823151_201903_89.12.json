The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is flanked by buildings on both sides, their facades bathed in the soft glow of daylight. In the distance, power lines crisscross against the backdrop of a hazy sky, adding a touch of urbanity to the scene. On the right side of the street, a blue fence stands out, its vibrant color contrasting with the muted tones of the buildings. The image beautifully encapsulates the blend of history and modernity that characterizes Beijing."}
