The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The sky is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The street is lined with lush green trees and bushes, adding a touch of nature to the urban landscape. Power lines stretch across the sky, connecting the buildings that dot the background. The buildings, painted in shades of white and gray, stand tall against the blue sky, their windows reflecting the sunlight. The image beautifully encapsulates the blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
