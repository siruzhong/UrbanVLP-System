The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow on the scene. Cars are parked along the side of the road, adding a touch of urban life to the otherwise serene landscape. The image beautifully encapsulates the blend of nature and city life in Beijing."}
