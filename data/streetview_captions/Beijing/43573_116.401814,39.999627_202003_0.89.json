The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings and the clear blue sky. The buildings, painted in shades of white and gray, rise majestically, their glass facades reflecting the sunlight. The street below is a hive of activity, with cars and buses moving along it, adding a dynamic element to the scene. On either side of the street, trees and bushes provide a touch of greenery, contrasting with the urban landscape. The image is bathed in the warm glow of the sun, which shines brightly in the top left corner, casting long shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings."}
