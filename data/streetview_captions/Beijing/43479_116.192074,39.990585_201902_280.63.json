The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, providing a stark contrast to the clear blue sky. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades bathed in sunlight. Cars parked along the side of the road add a touch of modernity to the scene. The sun shines brightly in the top left corner of the photo, casting long shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings."}
