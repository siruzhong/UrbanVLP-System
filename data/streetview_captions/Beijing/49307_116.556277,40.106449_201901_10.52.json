The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees on both sides, their leaves forming a natural canopy overhead. A concrete overpass arches over the street, providing a stark contrast to the verdant foliage. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun casting a bright light that illuminates the scene. In the distance, a few cars and pedestrians can be seen, adding a touch of life to the otherwise still image. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the green of the trees standing out against the blue of the sky."}
