The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of being in the midst of the action.

Cars and buses are parked along the sides of the street, hinting at the city's busy pace of life. The sky above is overcast, casting a soft light over the scene. In the distance, a crane stands tall, perhaps indicative of the city's continuous growth and development.
