The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of grandeur to the buildings and trees that line the street. The buildings, painted in shades of white and gray, stand tall against the backdrop of a clear blue sky. The trees, with their lush green leaves, add a touch of nature to the urban landscape. The sun shines brightly in the top right corner of the image, casting a warm glow over the scene."}
