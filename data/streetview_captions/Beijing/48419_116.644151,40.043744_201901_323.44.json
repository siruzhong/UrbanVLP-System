The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is flanked by buildings on both sides, their facades bathed in the warm glow of the setting sun. The buildings, predominantly white and gray, are punctuated by occasional splashes of red and green, adding a touch of vibrancy to the otherwise monochrome palette. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun setting in the distance, casting long shadows and bathing the scene in a soft, warm light. The image is a blend of urban architecture and natural elements, showcasing the harmonious coexistence of man-made structures and nature in Beijing."}
