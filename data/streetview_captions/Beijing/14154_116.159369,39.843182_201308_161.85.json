The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees and shrubs, providing a vibrant contrast to the clear blue sky. On the right side of the street, there's a traditional Chinese temple, its red roof and white walls standing out against the natural backdrop. A few cars are parked along the street, adding a touch of modern life to the otherwise serene setting. The image is bathed in the warm glow of the sun, casting long shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the temple and the surrounding greenery."}
