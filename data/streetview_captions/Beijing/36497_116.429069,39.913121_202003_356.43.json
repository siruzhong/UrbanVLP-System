The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly white and gray, punctuated by occasional red and green accents that add a touch of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun casting a bright light that illuminates the scene. In the foreground, trees and street furniture can be seen, adding depth and context to the urban landscape."}
