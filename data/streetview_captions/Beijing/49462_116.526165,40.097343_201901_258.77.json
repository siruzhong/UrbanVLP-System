The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the cityscape. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The image is slightly blurred, adding a sense of motion and dynamism to the otherwise static cityscape."}
