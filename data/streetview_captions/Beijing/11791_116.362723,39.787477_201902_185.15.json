The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of the city's towering structures. The sky above is a clear blue, providing a stark contrast to the urban landscape below. Buildings of various sizes and designs fill the background, interspersed with trees that add a touch of green to the scene. The street itself is lined with lampposts, standing like sentinels along the thoroughfare. Cars and buses can be seen in motion, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static cityscape."}
