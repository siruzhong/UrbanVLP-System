The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves forming a canopy overhead. The buildings flanking the street are made of brick, their red and brown hues adding a warm tone to the overall color palette of the image. The sky above is a clear blue, providing a striking contrast to the earthy tones of the buildings and trees."}
