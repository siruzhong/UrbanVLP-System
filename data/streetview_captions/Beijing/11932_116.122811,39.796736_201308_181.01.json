The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees on both sides, their leaves forming a canopy overhead. The road itself is slick with rain, reflecting the overcast sky above. A few cars can be seen driving down the road, their headlights cutting through the gloom. In the distance, buildings rise, their silhouettes faint against the cloudy sky. The colors in the image are predominantly green and gray, with the green of the trees contrasting with the gray of the wet road and overcast sky."}
