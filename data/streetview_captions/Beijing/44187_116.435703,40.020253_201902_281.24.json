The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of being in the midst of the action. The sky above is a clear blue, providing a stark contrast to the urban landscape below. Buildings of various sizes and designs line the street, their facades adorned with advertisements that add a splash of color to the scene. Cars and buses are scattered throughout the street, hinting at the city's constant movement and energy. Overhead, power lines crisscross against the sky, a common sight in many urban areas. In the distance, a bridge stretches across the scene, connecting different parts of the city."}
