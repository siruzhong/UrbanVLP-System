The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of depth and dimension to the scene. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. \n\nOn either side of the street, lush green trees stand tall, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. A blue fence runs along the right side of the street, adding a pop of color to the scene. On the left side of the street, a few buildings can be seen, their architecture hinting at the local culture and lifestyle. \n\nPower lines stretch across the sky, connecting the buildings and adding a touch of modernity to the otherwise natural landscape. The image beautifully encapsulates a typical day in Beijing, where tradition and modernity coexist harmoniously."}
