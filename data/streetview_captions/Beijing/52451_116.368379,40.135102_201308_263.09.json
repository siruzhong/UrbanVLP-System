The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves forming a canopy overhead. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it. On the right side of the street, there's a white wall, while on the left side, there's a sidewalk. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the green of the trees contrasting against the blue of the sky."}
