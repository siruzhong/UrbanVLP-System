The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves forming a natural canopy overhead. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene."}
