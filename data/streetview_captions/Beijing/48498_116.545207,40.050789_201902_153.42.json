The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the surroundings. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow on the scene and creating a lens flare effect in the image. The street itself is empty, adding to the tranquility of the scene. In the distance, power lines stretch across the sky, a subtle reminder of urban life amidst the natural beauty."}
