The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees and buildings, creating a harmonious blend of nature and architecture. Cars are parked along the side of the road, adding a touch of everyday life to the scene.
