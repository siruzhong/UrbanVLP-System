The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is flanked by trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of a clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The street itself is devoid of any traffic or pedestrians, adding a sense of tranquility to the image. In the distance, power lines stretch across the sky, a common sight in urban landscapes. The image does not contain any discernible text. The relative positions of the objects suggest a well-planned urban layout, with the trees neatly lining the street and the power lines running parallel to them. The image does not provide enough detail to confidently count the number of trees or power lines. The colors in the image are predominantly green from the trees, blue from the sky, and gray from the street and power lines. The image does not contain any imaginary content; everything described can be confidently determined from the image itself. The image does not contain any aesthetic descriptions."}
