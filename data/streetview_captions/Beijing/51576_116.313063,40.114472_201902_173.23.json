The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is flanked by trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. A few people can be seen walking on the sidewalk, adding a touch of life to the otherwise still image. In the distance, a bridge stretches across the street, connecting the two sides of the city. The image captures the essence of a typical day in Beijing, with its blend of nature and urban life."}
