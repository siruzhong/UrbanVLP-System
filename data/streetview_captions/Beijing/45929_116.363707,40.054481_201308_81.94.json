The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of depth and scale to the scene. The sky above is a clear blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds. Power lines crisscross the sky, adding a touch of urbanity to the otherwise natural landscape.\n\nOn the right side of the street, there's a white building with a gray roof, standing out against the blue sky. A green car is parked on the street, adding a pop of color to the scene. On the left side of the street, a fence runs parallel to the sidewalk, leading the eye towards a solitary tree standing tall in the background.\n\nThe image is a beautiful blend of urban and natural elements, showcasing the everyday life in Beijing. It's a snapshot of a moment, frozen in time, telling a story of a city that beautifully coexists with nature."}
