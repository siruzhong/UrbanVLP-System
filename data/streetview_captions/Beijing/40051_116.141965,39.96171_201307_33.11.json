The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The sky is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly in the top right corner, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. \n\nOn the left side of the street, there's a brick wall, adding a rustic charm to the urban setting. On the right side, there's a sidewalk lined with lush green trees and bushes, providing a refreshing contrast to the brick wall. \n\nIn the center of the image, power lines stretch across the scene, symbolizing the blend of nature and urban life in this city. A street lamp stands on the left side of the image, ready to illuminate the street as dusk falls. \n\nThe image beautifully encapsulates the essence of a typical day in Beijing, where tradition and modernity coexist harmoniously."}
