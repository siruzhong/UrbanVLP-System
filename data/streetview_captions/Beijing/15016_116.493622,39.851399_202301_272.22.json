It's constructed from metal and painted in shades of green and blue, adding a pop of color to the otherwise neutral palette of the scene. This archway serves as a focal point, drawing the viewer's eye towards it.\n\nThe street is not devoid of life. A few people can be seen walking on the sidewalk, going about their day. A motorcycle is parked on the side of the street, perhaps belonging to one of the passersby.\n\nOverall, the image captures a typical day on a street in Beijing, showcasing the city's vibrant urban life and architectural diversity."}
