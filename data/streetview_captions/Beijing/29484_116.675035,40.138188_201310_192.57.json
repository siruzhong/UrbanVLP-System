The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of looking up at the towering buildings and lush green trees that line the street. The sky above is a clear blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds. The street itself is a hive of activity, with cars and buses moving along it, adding a dynamic element to the scene. The buildings, painted in shades of white and gray, rise high into the sky, their windows reflecting the sunlight. The greenery on either side of the street provides a refreshing contrast to the urban landscape."}
