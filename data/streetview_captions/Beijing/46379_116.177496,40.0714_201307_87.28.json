The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the surroundings. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. The sun shines brightly in the clear blue sky, casting a warm glow on the scene. The buildings in the background, painted in shades of white and gray, add a touch of urban charm to the otherwise natural landscape. The image beautifully encapsulates the blend of nature and architecture that characterizes Beijing."}
