The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly beige and white, punctuated by occasional red and green accents that add a touch of color to the urban landscape. The street itself is a hive of activity, filled with cars and buses navigating their way through the city's arteries. Pedestrians can be seen as well, adding a human element to the scene.
