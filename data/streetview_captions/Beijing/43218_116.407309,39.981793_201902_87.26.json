The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly white and gray, with occasional red and green accents adding a touch of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. \n\nThe street itself is lined with trees and lampposts, adding a sense of order and symmetry to the scene. Cars and buses are parked along the side of the road, hinting at the daily life and activity in this part of the city. The sky above is a clear blue, providing a stark contrast to the urban landscape below."}
