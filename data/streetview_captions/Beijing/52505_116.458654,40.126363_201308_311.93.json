A white car is parked on the right side of the street, facing away from the camera, as if ready to embark on a journey. The street itself is flanked by lush greenery, with trees and shrubs dotting the landscape, adding a touch of nature to the urban setting. Above, the sky is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene. The perspective of the image is from the left side of the street, looking towards the right, giving a sense of depth and dimension to the scene. The image does not contain any text or other discernible details. The relative positions of the objects suggest a quiet, possibly early morning or late afternoon, moment on this street in Beijing."}
