The perspective is from the sidewalk, looking down the length of the street. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves forming a canopy overhead. A blue fence runs along the right side of the street, adding a pop of color to the scene. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun casting a bright light that illuminates the scene."}
