The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees and bushes, providing a vibrant contrast to the clear blue sky above. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. Power lines stretch across the sky, adding a touch of urbanity to the otherwise natural landscape. In the distance, a large white archway stands out, possibly indicating a significant landmark or entrance. The image beautifully captures the blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
