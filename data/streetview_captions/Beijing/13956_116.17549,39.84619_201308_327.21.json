The street, bathed in the soft glow of daylight, is flanked by lush green trees on both sides, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it, adding to the serene ambiance of the scene.\n\nOn the right side of the street, there's a small building with a gray roof, standing out against the verdant backdrop. Its presence adds a touch of urbanity to the otherwise natural landscape. On the left side of the street, a large tree stands tall, its branches reaching out towards the sky, as if trying to touch the clouds.\n\nThe image is captured from a low angle, giving a unique perspective to the viewer. It's as if one is standing on the street, looking up at the towering trees and the clear blue sky. The overall composition of the image beautifully captures the essence of a peaceful day in Beijing."}
