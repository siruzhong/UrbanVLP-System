The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their green leaves contrasting with the clear blue sky above. A few cars are parked along the side of the road, adding a touch of modernity to the otherwise serene setting. In the distance, buildings rise, their architecture hinting at the blend of traditional and modern styles that characterize Beijing."}
