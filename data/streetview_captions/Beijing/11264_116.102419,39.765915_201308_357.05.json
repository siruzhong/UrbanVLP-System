The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with traditional Chinese buildings, their white walls contrasting with the red roofs. These buildings are adorned with ornate details, reflecting the rich architectural heritage of the region. Overhead, power lines crisscross against the backdrop of a clear blue sky. The image is slightly distorted due to the fisheye lens effect, adding a unique perspective to the urban landscape."}
