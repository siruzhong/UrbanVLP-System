The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with buildings on both sides, their facades bathed in the warm glow of the setting sun. Cars and buses are scattered along the road, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static urban landscape. The sky above is a clear blue, providing a stark contrast to the earthy tones of the buildings. In the distance, trees can be seen, their green foliage adding a touch of nature to the urban setting. The image is bathed in the soft light of the setting sun, casting long shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings."}
