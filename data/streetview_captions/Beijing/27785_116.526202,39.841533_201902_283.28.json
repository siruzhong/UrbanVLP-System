The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of the city's towering buildings and busy streets. The buildings, predominantly white and gray, line the street, their facades adorned with vibrant signs and advertisements that add a splash of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. Overhead, power lines crisscross the sky, a common sight in many urban areas. The sky itself is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the scene."}
