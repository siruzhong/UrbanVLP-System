The perspective is from a high angle, providing a bird's eye view of the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees and bushes, adding a touch of nature to the urban landscape. Cars are parked neatly on the side of the road, hinting at the hustle and bustle of city life. In the distance, buildings rise, their gray facades blending with the overcast sky.
