The trees are evenly spaced, creating a rhythmic pattern that adds to the visual appeal of the scene. In the distance, a few buildings can be seen, their presence subtly hinting at the urban environment surrounding this serene street. The image does not contain any discernible text or specific actions being performed by objects. The relative positions of the objects remain constant, with the trees lining the street and the buildings standing tall in the background. The colors in the image are predominantly green from the trees, blue from the sky, and gray from the buildings. The image does not provide enough detail to confidently count the number of trees or buildings.
