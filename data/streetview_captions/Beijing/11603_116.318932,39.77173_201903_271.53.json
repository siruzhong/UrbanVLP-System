The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of the city's towering buildings and busy streets. The buildings, painted in shades of white and gray, rise high into the clear blue sky. Their facades are adorned with various signs and advertisements, adding a splash of color to the otherwise monochrome palette.\n\nThe street itself is a hive of activity. Cars and buses fill the road, their metallic bodies gleaming under the bright sunlight. Trees line the sides of the street, providing a touch of greenery amidst the urban landscape. The sun shines brightly in the background, casting long shadows and bathing the scene in a warm glow."}
