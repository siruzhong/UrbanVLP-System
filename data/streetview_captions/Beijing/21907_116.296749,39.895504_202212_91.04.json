The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings and the clear blue sky. The buildings, painted in hues of white and beige, rise majestically on either side of the street, their facades reflecting the sunlight. The street itself is a hive of activity, with cars and buses moving along its length, adding a dynamic element to the scene. On the right side of the street, trees and bushes provide a touch of greenery, contrasting with the urban landscape. The image is bathed in the warm glow of a sunny day, casting long shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings."}
