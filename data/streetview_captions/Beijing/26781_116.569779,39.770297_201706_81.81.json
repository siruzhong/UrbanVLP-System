The viewer's perspective is that of a pedestrian standing on the sidewalk, looking down the length of the street. The street itself is flanked by lush green trees, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. A river, calm and tranquil, runs parallel to the street, reflecting the clear blue sky above. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. In the distance, buildings rise, their muted colors blending harmoniously with the natural surroundings. The image is taken from a low angle, adding a sense of depth and perspective to the scene. The overall effect is a harmonious blend of nature and architecture, a characteristic feature of Beijing's urban landscape."}
