The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the image. The trees, standing tall on both sides of the street, are lush and green, their leaves forming a natural canopy overhead. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The image is bathed in natural light, highlighting the vibrant colors and creating a lively atmosphere."}
