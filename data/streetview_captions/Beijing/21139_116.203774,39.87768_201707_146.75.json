The perspective is from a high angle, providing a bird's eye view of the scene. The street, lined with power lines, extends into the distance, creating a sense of depth and scale. Buildings flank the street on both sides, their facades bathed in the soft light of day. Cars are parked neatly along the side of the road, adding a touch of everyday life to the scene. The sky above is overcast, casting a muted palette of colors over the entire landscape. Despite the absence of vibrant hues, the image exudes a certain tranquility, as if time has slowed down in this quiet corner of the city."}
