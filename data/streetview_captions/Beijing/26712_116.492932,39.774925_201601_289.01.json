The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees and shrubs, adding a touch of nature to the urban landscape. The buildings on either side of the street are predominantly white and gray, their neutral tones contrasting with the vibrant greenery. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The image does not contain any discernible text or specific actions being performed by objects or individuals. The relative positions of the objects suggest a well-planned urban layout, with the buildings, trees, and shrubs neatly arranged along the street. The image does not provide enough detail to confidently count the number of objects or identify specific types of objects beyond what has been described."}
