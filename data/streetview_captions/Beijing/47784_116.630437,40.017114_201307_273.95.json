The street, bathed in the warm glow of the sun, is lined with lush green trees on both sides, creating a natural canopy overhead. The perspective of the image is from a low angle, giving a sense of depth and scale to the scene. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly in the top right corner, casting long shadows on the ground. The image is taken from a distance, allowing for a comprehensive view of the street and its surroundings. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the green of the trees contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky. The image does not contain any text or countable objects, and there are no discernible actions taking place. The relative positions of the objects suggest a well-planned urban layout, with the trees neatly lining the street and the buildings maintaining a respectful distance. The image is a testament to the harmonious coexistence of nature and urban development in Beijing."}
