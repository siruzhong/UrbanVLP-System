The perspective is from the middle of the street, looking towards the horizon. The street is flanked by lush green trees on both sides, creating a natural canopy overhead. Power lines stretch across the scene, following the path of the road. A few cars and motorcycles are parked on the side of the road, adding a touch of urban life to the otherwise serene setting. The sky above is a clear blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds. The image is taken from a low angle, which gives a sense of depth and scale to the scene. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the green of the trees contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky."}
