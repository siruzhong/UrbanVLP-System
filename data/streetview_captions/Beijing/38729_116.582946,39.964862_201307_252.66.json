The street, bathed in the soft glow of daylight, is flanked by lush green trees and shrubs, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. A red car, vibrant against the muted colors of the surroundings, is parked on the left side of the street, adding a pop of color to the scene. \n\nOn the right side of the street, a pile of rocks lies scattered, their rugged texture contrasting with the smooth pavement of the road. The sky above is a clear blue, its vast expanse visible in the top left corner of the image. The perspective of the image is from the middle of the street, looking towards the horizon, giving a sense of depth and scale to the scene."}
