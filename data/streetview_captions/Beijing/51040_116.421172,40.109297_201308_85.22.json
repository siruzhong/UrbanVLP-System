The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The sky is a clear blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds and bathed in bright sunlight. The street itself is lined with lush green trees and grass, adding a touch of nature to the urban landscape. In the distance, buildings rise, their details softened by the distance. The image is captured using a fisheye lens, which distorts the edges of the frame, adding a unique perspective to the scene."}
