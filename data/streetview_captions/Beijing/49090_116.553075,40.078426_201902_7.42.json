The perspective is from the sidewalk, looking down the length of the street. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green. Cars are parked neatly on the side of the road, their metallic bodies gleaming under the sunlight. Buildings rise in the background, their facades bathed in the warm glow of the sun. The sky above is a clear blue, and the sun shines brightly, casting long shadows and illuminating the scene with a soft light. The image captures the essence of a typical day in Beijing, with its blend of urban architecture and natural elements."}
