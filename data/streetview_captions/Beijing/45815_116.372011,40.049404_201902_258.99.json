The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the image. The street is flanked by trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. A blue fence runs along the right side of the street, adding a pop of color to the scene. The sun shines brightly in the background, casting a warm glow over the entire landscape. The image beautifully encapsulates the tranquility and beauty of a typical day in Beijing."}
