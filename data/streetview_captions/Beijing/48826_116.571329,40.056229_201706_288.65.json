The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the surroundings.

Power lines stretch across the sky, following the path of the street. On the right side of the street, a brick wall stands tall, adding a touch of rustic charm to the scene. \n\nIn the distance, a yellow gate can be seen, its vibrant color contrasting beautifully with the greenery around it. The gate appears to be closed, adding a sense of mystery to the scene. The overall image paints a picture of a peaceful day in a charming neighborhood in Beijing."}
