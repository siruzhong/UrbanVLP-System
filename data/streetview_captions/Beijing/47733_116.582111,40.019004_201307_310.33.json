The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, providing a vibrant contrast to the clear blue sky. On the left side of the street, there's a red brick wall, adding a touch of rustic charm to the urban landscape. On the right side, a blue sign stands out, although the text on it is not visible in the image. A car is captured in motion on the street, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static scene. The image beautifully captures the blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
