The street, bathed in the warm glow of the sun, is flanked by lush green trees on both sides. The trees, standing tall and proud, add a sense of tranquility to the scene. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting long shadows of the trees onto the street below. The perspective of the image is from a low angle, looking up at the towering trees and the expansive sky, creating a sense of depth and scale. The image does not contain any text or discernible actions. The relative positions of the objects suggest a well-planned urban landscape, with the trees neatly lining the street and the buildings maintaining a respectful distance. The image is a testament to the harmonious coexistence of nature and urban development in Beijing."}
