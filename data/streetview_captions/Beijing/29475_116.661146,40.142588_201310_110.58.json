The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves forming a canopy overhead. The road itself is divided by a median, and a sidewalk runs parallel to it on the right side. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it. The image appears to have been captured using a fisheye lens, which adds a unique distortion to the edges of the frame, enhancing the panoramic effect."}
