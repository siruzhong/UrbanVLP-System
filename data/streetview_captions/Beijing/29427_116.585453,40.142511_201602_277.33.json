The perspective is from a high vantage point, providing a bird's eye view of the scene below. The street, divided by a green median, stretches out into the distance, flanked by buildings and trees on both sides. A few cars and buses can be seen navigating the road, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static urban landscape. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene."}
