The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the buildings and trees that line the street. The buildings, painted in shades of gray and brown, stand tall against the backdrop of a clear blue sky. The trees, devoid of leaves, add a stark contrast to the urban landscape. The sun casts its warm glow from the right side of the image, illuminating the scene with a soft light."}
