The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with power lines and street lamps, adding a touch of urban charm. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun casting a bright light that illuminates the scene.
