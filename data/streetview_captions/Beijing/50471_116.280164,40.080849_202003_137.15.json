The perspective is from a car on the road, giving a sense of being in the midst of the action. The sky above is a clear blue, providing a vibrant backdrop to the urban landscape below. Power lines crisscross above the road, a common sight in many cities. On either side of the road, trees and buildings rise up, their details softened by the distance.
