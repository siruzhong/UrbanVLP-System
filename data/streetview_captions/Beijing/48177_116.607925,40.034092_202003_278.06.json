The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow on the scene and creating a lens flare in the top left corner of the image. In the distance, buildings rise, their details softened by the perspective. The image is bathed in natural light, highlighting the colors and creating a lively atmosphere."}
