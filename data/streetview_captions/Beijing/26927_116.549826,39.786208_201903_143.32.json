The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with modern buildings, their facades predominantly white and gray, punctuated by occasional blue and green accents that add a touch of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. Construction cranes can be seen in the distance, hinting at the ongoing development and progress in the city. The sky above is a clear blue, providing a stark contrast to the urban landscape below."}
