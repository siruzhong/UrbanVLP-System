The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the buildings that line the street. The buildings, mostly white and gray, are adorned with red and green accents, adding a splash of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. \n\nThe street itself is lined with lush green trees and bushes, providing a stark contrast to the urban landscape. Cars of various colors are parked along the side of the road, hinting at the busy life of the city. People can be seen walking on the sidewalk, going about their day, adding a human element to the scene. \n\nThe image is slightly distorted due to the fisheye lens used, giving it a unique, almost surreal quality. Despite this distortion, the image faithfully captures the essence of a typical day on a busy street in Beijing."}
