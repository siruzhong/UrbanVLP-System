The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of the towering buildings that line the street. These structures, predominantly white and gray, rise high into the overcast sky, their monotone palette punctuated by occasional splashes of red and green. The street itself is a hive of activity, filled with cars and buses navigating their way through the urban maze. Amidst the concrete jungle, patches of greenery provide a refreshing contrast, hinting at the presence of trees and parks scattered throughout the city."}
