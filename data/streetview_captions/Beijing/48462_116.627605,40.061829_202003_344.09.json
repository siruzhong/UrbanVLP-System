The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the surroundings. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. Bare trees stand tall against the backdrop of a clear blue sky, their branches reaching out as if trying to touch the heavens. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow on the scene and creating a lens flare in the top left corner of the image. The colors are vibrant and full of life, adding to the overall charm of the scene. The image beautifully encapsulates the tranquility and beauty of a typical day in Beijing."}
