The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves rustling in the unseen breeze, casting dappled shadows on the pavement. On either side of the street, buildings rise, their facades adorned with vibrant signs and advertisements, adding a splash of color to the scene. The sky above is a clear blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds, casting a serene backdrop to the bustling cityscape below.
