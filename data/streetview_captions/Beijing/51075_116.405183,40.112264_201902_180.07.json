The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the surroundings. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. Street lamps stand sentinel along the sidewalk, their presence hinting at the soft glow that would light up the street as dusk falls. Buildings rise in the background, their windows reflecting the clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly overhead, casting long shadows and bathing the scene in a warm, inviting light. The image is a beautiful blend of urban architecture and natural elements, showcasing the harmonious coexistence of man-made structures and nature in Beijing."}
