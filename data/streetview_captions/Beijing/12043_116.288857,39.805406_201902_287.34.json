The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the stark white of the overcast sky. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades bathed in the soft light filtering through the trees. Cars parked along the side of the road add a touch of modernity to the scene. The colors in the image are muted, with the green of the trees and the gray of the overcast sky dominating the palette."}
