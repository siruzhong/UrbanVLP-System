The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees and grass, creating a serene atmosphere. Power lines crisscross above, adding a touch of urbanity to the otherwise natural landscape. In the distance, buildings rise, their silhouettes faint against the hazy sky. The colors in the image are predominantly green and gray, reflecting the blend of nature and cityscape."}
