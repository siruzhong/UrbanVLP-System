The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves forming a canopy that filters the sunlight. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the green of the trees contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky."}
