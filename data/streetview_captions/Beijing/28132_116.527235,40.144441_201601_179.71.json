The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the surroundings. The street is flanked by trees on both sides, their bare branches reaching out into the clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene. On the right side of the street, there's a small building with a red roof, adding a pop of color to the otherwise monochrome landscape. The image beautifully encapsulates the tranquility and beauty of a typical day in Beijing."}
