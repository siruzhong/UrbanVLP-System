The highway, divided by a concrete median, stretches out ahead, disappearing into the distance. On either side of the highway, tall buildings rise, their facades bathed in the warm glow of the setting sun. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it. The sun shines brightly, casting long shadows and illuminating the scene with a golden light. The image is taken from a low angle, giving a sense of looking up at the towering buildings and the expansive sky. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the blue of the sky contrasting with the warm hues of the buildings. The image does not provide enough information to confidently identify the specific worldwide landmark."}
