The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow on the scene. Cars are parked along the side of the road, adding a touch of urban life to the otherwise serene setting. In the distance, buildings rise, their silhouettes faint but visible against the sky. The image is bathed in the light of day, highlighting the colors and details of the scene."}
