The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. A black car is parked on the right side of the street, adding a touch of modernity to the otherwise tranquil setting. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene."}
