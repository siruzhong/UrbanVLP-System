The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly white and gray, punctuated by occasional red and green accents that add a touch of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. The street itself is a hive of activity, filled with cars and buses navigating their way through the city's arteries. On either side of the street, trees stand tall, their green foliage contrasting with the urban landscape. Above, the sky is a clear blue, devoid of any clouds, suggesting a bright and sunny day."}
