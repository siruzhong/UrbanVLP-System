The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the image. The sky is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly in the top left corner, casting a warm glow over the scene. The trees, lush and green, line both sides of the street, their leaves forming a natural canopy overhead. In the distance, a few buildings peek through the foliage, adding a touch of urbanity to the otherwise natural landscape. The image is bathed in natural daylight, highlighting the vibrant colors and textures of the scene."}
