The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the buildings that line the street. The buildings, predominantly white and gray, are adorned with accents of blue and green, adding a touch of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. \n\nVehicles, including cars and buses, are scattered along the street, indicating a busy time of day. The sky above is hazy, casting a soft light over the scene. In the distance, trees can be seen, providing a touch of nature amidst the urban landscape."}
