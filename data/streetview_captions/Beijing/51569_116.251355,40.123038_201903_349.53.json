The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with buildings and trees, creating a harmonious blend of urban and natural elements. The buildings, painted in shades of white and red, stand tall against the backdrop of a clear blue sky. The trees, with their bare branches reaching out, add a touch of serenity to the bustling cityscape. The image beautifully encapsulates the essence of Beijing, a city where tradition and modernity coexist."}
