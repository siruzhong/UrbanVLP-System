The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the image. The trees, lush and green, form a natural canopy over the street, their leaves creating a beautiful pattern of light and shadow. The sky, peeking through the gaps in the leaves, adds a touch of blue to the otherwise green and brown landscape. The image is slightly distorted due to the fisheye lens effect, adding an artistic touch to the photograph."}
