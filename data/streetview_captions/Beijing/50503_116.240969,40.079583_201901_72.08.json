The street is lined with trees and buildings, creating a harmonious blend of nature and architecture. The buildings, painted in shades of white and gray, stand tall against the backdrop of a clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the green of the trees contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky. The image does not contain any text or specific actions being performed by objects. The relative positions of the objects suggest a well-planned urban layout, with buildings and trees neatly arranged along the street. The image does not provide enough detail to confidently count the number of objects or identify specific types of objects beyond those described. The image does not contain any imaginary content; everything described can be confidently determined from the image itself. The image does not contain any aesthetic descriptions."}
