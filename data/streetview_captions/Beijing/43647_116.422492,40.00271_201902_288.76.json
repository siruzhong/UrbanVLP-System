The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of the towering buildings that line the street. These structures, predominantly white and gray, rise high into the clear blue sky, their windows reflecting the sunlight. The street itself is a hive of activity, with cars and buses moving along its length, adding a dynamic element to the scene. On either side of the street, trees and bushes provide a touch of greenery, contrasting with the urban architecture. The sun shines brightly overhead, casting long shadows and illuminating the scene with a warm glow."}
