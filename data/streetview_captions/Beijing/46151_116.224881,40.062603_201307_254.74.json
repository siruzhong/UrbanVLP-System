The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees and shrubs, adding a touch of nature to the urban landscape. A car can be seen driving down the road, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static scene. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The image beautifully encapsulates the blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
