The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves forming a canopy over the road. Cars are parked neatly on the side of the road, adding a touch of modernity to the otherwise serene setting. In the distance, buildings rise, their architecture hinting at the blend of tradition and modernity that characterizes Beijing. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the green of the trees contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky."}
