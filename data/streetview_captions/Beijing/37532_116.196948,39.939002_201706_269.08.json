The viewer's perspective is that of a pedestrian standing on the sidewalk, looking down the length of the street. The street itself is lined with lush green trees, their leaves forming a canopy overhead. On the right side of the street, there's a construction site, cordoned off by a blue and white striped barrier. A red and white sign stands prominently on this barrier, although the text on it is not visible in the image. The sky above is a clear blue, suggesting a bright and sunny day. The image does not contain any discernible text. The relative positions of the objects are such that the construction site is to the right of the sidewalk, while the trees line the left side of the street. The image does not provide enough detail to confidently count the number of trees or other objects. The colors in the image are predominantly green from the trees, blue from the sky, and gray from the construction site."}
