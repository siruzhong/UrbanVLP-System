The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The trees, with their lush green leaves, stand tall on both sides of the street, creating a natural canopy overhead. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. In the distance, you can see buildings peeking through the foliage, adding a touch of urbanity to the otherwise natural landscape. The image beautifully encapsulates the blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
