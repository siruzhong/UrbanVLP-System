The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly gray and white, punctuated by occasional blue and red accents that add a splash of color to the urban landscape. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene. The street itself is lined with lush green trees, providing a stark contrast to the concrete structures. Cars and buses can be seen in motion on the road, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static cityscape."}
