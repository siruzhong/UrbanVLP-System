The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city. Cars are parked neatly on the side of the road, their metallic bodies gleaming under the soft light. Overhead, power lines crisscross the sky, forming a complex web that mirrors the city's bustling energy. The sky above is a clear blue, devoid of clouds, casting a serene backdrop to the urban landscape below."}
