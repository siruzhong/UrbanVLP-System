The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees and buildings, creating a canopy of greenery and architecture. The buildings are predominantly gray and white, with occasional red and blue accents adding a splash of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene."}
