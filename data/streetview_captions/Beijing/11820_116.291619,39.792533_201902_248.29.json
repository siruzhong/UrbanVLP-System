The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves forming a natural canopy overhead. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades bathed in sunlight. Power lines crisscross above, creating a network of lines against the sky. The sky itself is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting shadows and highlighting the colors of the scene."}
