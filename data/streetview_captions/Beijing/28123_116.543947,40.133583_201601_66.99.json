The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves forming a natural canopy overhead. On the right side of the street, there's a large white building with a blue roof, standing out against the greenery. This building appears to be a factory or warehouse, as suggested by its industrial design. The sky above is a clear blue, and the sun is shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The image does not contain any text or discernible actions by objects. The relative positions of the objects suggest a well-planned urban layout, with buildings and trees neatly arranged along the street. The image does not provide enough detail to confidently count the number of objects or identify specific types of objects beyond those described. The colors in the image are predominantly green from the trees, white from the building, and blue from the sky."}
