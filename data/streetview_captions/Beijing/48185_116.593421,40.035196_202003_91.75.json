The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of a clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene and creating a lens flare in the top left corner of the image. In the distance, a building with a distinctive red roof can be seen, adding a pop of color to the otherwise green and blue landscape. The image is bathed in natural light, highlighting the colors and details of the scene."}
