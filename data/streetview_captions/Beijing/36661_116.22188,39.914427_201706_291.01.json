The perspective is from the middle of the street, looking towards the horizon. The street is flanked by lush green trees on both sides, creating a natural canopy overhead. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered in the distance. The road itself is divided into two lanes by a white dashed line, indicating a two-way traffic system. On the right side of the street, there's a blue sign with white text, although the exact content of the text isn't discernible from the image. The overall scene suggests a peaceful and serene day in this part of Beijing."}
