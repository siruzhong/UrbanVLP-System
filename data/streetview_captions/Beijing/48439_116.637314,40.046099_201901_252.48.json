The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with modern buildings, their facades predominantly white and gray, punctuated by occasional splashes of red and green. Cars and buses traverse the road, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static urban landscape. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun casting a bright light that illuminates the scene, enhancing the colors and details of the buildings and vehicles."}
