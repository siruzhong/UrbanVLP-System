The trees, tall and lush with green leaves, stand on either side of the street, their branches reaching out as if to touch each other. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm light that illuminates the scene. The perspective of the image is from a low angle, looking up at the towering trees and the expansive sky, creating a sense of depth and openness."}
