The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, providing a stark contrast to the clear blue sky. On the left side of the street, there's a modern building with a unique triangular roof, painted in shades of gray and white. This building stands out prominently against the backdrop of the cityscape. On the right side of the street, there's a red brick wall, adding a touch of rustic charm to the otherwise modern setting. The sun shines brightly in the top left corner of the image, casting a warm glow over the entire scene."}
