The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly white and gray, punctuated by occasional red and blue accents that add a splash of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun casting a bright light that illuminates the scene. The street itself is lined with lush green trees and bushes, providing a stark contrast to the urban architecture. A few people can be seen walking on the sidewalk, adding a touch of life to the scene. In the foreground, a scooter and a car are parked, hinting at the daily hustle and bustle of city life."}
