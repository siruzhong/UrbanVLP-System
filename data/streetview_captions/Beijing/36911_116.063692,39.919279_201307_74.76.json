The street itself is paved with gray asphalt, a common sight in urban areas. A few buildings can be seen in the distance, their muted colors blending harmoniously with the natural surroundings. \n\nThe image does not contain any discernible text or specific actions being performed by objects. The relative positions of the objects suggest a well-planned urban layout, with buildings, trees, and the street all neatly aligned. The image does not provide enough detail to confidently count the number of objects or identify specific types of objects beyond what has been described. \n\nOverall, the image presents a tranquil snapshot of everyday life in Beijing, where nature and urban development coexist in harmony."}
