The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly gray and white, punctuated by occasional blue and green accents that add a touch of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. The street itself is a hive of activity, filled with cars and buses navigating their way through the city's arteries. On either side of the street, trees and bushes provide a touch of nature amidst the urban landscape. The sky overhead is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the scene."}
