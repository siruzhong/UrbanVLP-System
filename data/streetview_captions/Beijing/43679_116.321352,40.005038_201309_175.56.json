The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves rustling in the unseen breeze. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades bathed in the warm glow of the sun. Cars are parked neatly on the side of the road, their metallic bodies gleaming under the sunlight. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting long shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings."}
