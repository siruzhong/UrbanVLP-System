The perspective is from the middle of the street, looking towards the horizon. The sky above is a clear blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds. On either side of the street, lush green trees stand tall, their leaves rustling in the breeze. The street itself is a vibrant display of urban life, with cars and buses moving along it, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise serene landscape. The sun shines brightly overhead, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The image is captured from a low angle, making the viewer feel as if they are standing right there on the street, taking in the sights of this bustling city."}
