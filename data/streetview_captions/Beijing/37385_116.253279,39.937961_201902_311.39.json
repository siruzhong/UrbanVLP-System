The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves forming a natural canopy overhead. A fence runs along the right side of the street, adding a touch of man-made structure to the otherwise natural landscape. The sky above is a clear blue, and the sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. In the distance, a large roundabout can be seen, hinting at the bustling city life beyond the tranquility of the street. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the green of the trees contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky."}
