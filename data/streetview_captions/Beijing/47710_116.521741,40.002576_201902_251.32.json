The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves forming a green canopy overhead. Power lines crisscross above the street, adding a touch of urbanity to the scene. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city. The sky above is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the scene."}
