The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees and shrubs, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. On the right side of the street, there's a small building with a distinctive red roof, adding a splash of color to the scene. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The image beautifully encapsulates the tranquility and beauty of a typical day in Beijing."}
