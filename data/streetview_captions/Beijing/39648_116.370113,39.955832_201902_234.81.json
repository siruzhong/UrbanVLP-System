The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of being in the midst of the action. The street is lined with buildings on both sides, their facades bathed in the warm glow of the sun. Bare trees stand tall, their branches reaching out towards the clear blue sky. Cars and trucks are parked along the side of the road, adding to the urban atmosphere. The sun shines brightly, casting long shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings."}
