The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. In the distance, buildings rise, their details softened by the perspective. The image appears to have been taken during the day, as suggested by the bright lighting and clear visibility."}
