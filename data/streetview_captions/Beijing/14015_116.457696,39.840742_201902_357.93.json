The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of the city's towering buildings and busy streets. The sky above is a clear blue, providing a stark contrast to the white buildings that line the street. These structures are adorned with red and yellow signs, adding a splash of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. Cars and buses fill the street, hinting at the city's vibrant life. The sun shines brightly in the top left corner of the image, casting long shadows and illuminating the scene with a warm glow."}
