The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees on both sides, creating a natural canopy overhead. A black car is parked on the right side of the street, adding a touch of modernity to the otherwise serene setting. On the left side of the street, a building with a red roof stands out, its vibrant color contrasting with the greenery around it. The sky above is a clear blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds, completing the picturesque scene."}
