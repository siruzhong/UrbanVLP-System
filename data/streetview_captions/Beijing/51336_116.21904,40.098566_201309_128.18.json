The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the image. The trees, with their lush green foliage, line both sides of the street, their leaves forming a natural canopy overhead. The sky above is a clear blue, adding a vibrant contrast to the greenery below. In the distance, a body of water can be seen, adding another layer of tranquility to the scene. The image is bathed in the soft light of day, highlighting the colors and details of the landscape."}
