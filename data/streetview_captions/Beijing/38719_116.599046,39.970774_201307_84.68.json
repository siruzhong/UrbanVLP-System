The street, bathed in the soft glow of daylight, stretches out into the distance, flanked by lush green trees on both sides. A white van is parked on the right side of the street, adding a touch of urban life to the otherwise serene setting. The perspective of the image is from a low angle, looking down the length of the street, giving a sense of depth and scale to the scene. The colors in the image are predominantly green and gray, reflecting the natural and man-made elements of the landscape."}
