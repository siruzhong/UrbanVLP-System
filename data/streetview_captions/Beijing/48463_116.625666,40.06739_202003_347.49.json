The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene.

On the right side of the street, there's a white fence running parallel to it, adding a touch of elegance to the urban landscape. \n\nOn the left side of the street, a few cars are parked, their colors muted under the bright sunlight. In the distance, a bridge stretches across the scene, connecting two parts of the city. The buildings in the background stand tall, their windows reflecting the sunlight, adding depth to the image. \n\nThe image is a beautiful representation of a sunny day in Beijing, capturing the city's blend of nature and urban life."}
