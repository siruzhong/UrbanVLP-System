The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the buildings that line the street. The buildings, painted in shades of white and gray, rise high into the clear blue sky, punctuated by a bright sun in the top right corner. The street itself is a hive of activity, with cars and buses moving along it, adding a dynamic element to the scene. On the left side of the street, trees and bushes provide a touch of greenery, contrasting with the urban environment. The image is bathed in the warm glow of the sun, casting long shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings."}
