The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with buildings on both sides, their facades painted in shades of blue and white, adding a touch of color to the urban landscape. Power lines crisscross above, connecting the buildings and creating a network of lines against the sky. In the distance, a large tree stands tall, its leaves a vibrant green, providing a natural contrast to the man-made structures. The sky above is a clear blue, dotted with a few clouds, completing the picture of a typical day in this bustling city."}
