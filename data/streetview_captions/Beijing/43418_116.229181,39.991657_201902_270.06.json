The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the cityscape. A car is parked on the right side of the street, adding a touch of everyday life to the scene. The sky above is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the entire scene. The colors in the image are muted, with the green of the trees and the gray of the overcast sky dominating the palette."}
