The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of a clear blue sky. The trees are evenly spaced, creating a rhythmic pattern that guides the viewer's eye along the street. In the distance, power lines stretch across the sky, adding another layer of detail to the urban landscape. The colors in the image are rich and natural, with the green of the trees contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky."}
