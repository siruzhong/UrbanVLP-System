The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves forming a canopy overhead, providing shade and adding a touch of nature to the urban setting. Two cars are parked on the side of the road, hinting at the life and activity in the area. In the distance, a building with a blue roof stands out, its vibrant color contrasting with the greenery around it. The sky above is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the scene."}
