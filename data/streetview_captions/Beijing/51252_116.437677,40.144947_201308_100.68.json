The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, which is a clear blue with a few scattered clouds. The trees, lush and green, stand tall on either side of the street, their leaves forming a natural canopy overhead. The sun shines brightly in the background, casting a warm glow over the scene. The street itself is paved with gray pavement, and there are a few buildings visible in the distance, adding a touch of urbanity to the otherwise natural landscape. The image is a beautiful representation of the blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
