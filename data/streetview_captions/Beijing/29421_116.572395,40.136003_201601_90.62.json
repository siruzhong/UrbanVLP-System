The viewer's perspective is that of a pedestrian standing on the sidewalk, immersed in the city's daily life. The street, lined with trees and buildings, extends into the distance, creating a sense of depth and scale. Overhead, power lines crisscross against the backdrop of a clear blue sky. The image is taken from a low angle, adding a dynamic perspective that emphasizes the height of the buildings and the expanse of the sky."}
