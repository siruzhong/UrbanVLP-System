The viewer's perspective is that of a pedestrian standing on the sidewalk, looking down the length of the street. The street itself is flanked on both sides by lush green trees and bushes, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. In the distance, power lines stretch across the sky, following the curve of the street. A few buildings, their facades partially obscured by the foliage, can be seen on the right side of the street. The image is taken from a low angle, adding a sense of depth and perspective to the scene."}
