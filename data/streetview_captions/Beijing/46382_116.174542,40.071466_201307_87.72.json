The street, bathed in the warm glow of the sun, is lined with lush green trees on both sides, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting long shadows of the trees onto the street. A few cars are parked along the side of the road, their metallic bodies gleaming under the sunlight. The perspective of the image is from a low angle, looking up at the towering trees and the expansive sky, creating a sense of depth and scale. The image is slightly distorted due to the fisheye lens effect, adding a unique perspective to the scene."}
