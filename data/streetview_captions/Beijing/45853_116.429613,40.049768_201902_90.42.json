The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of the towering buildings that line the street. These structures, predominantly gray and brown, rise high into the overcast sky, their windows reflecting the muted light. The street itself is a hive of activity, with cars and buses moving along its length, their colors muted under the gray sky. On the sidewalks, people can be seen going about their day, adding a human element to the urban landscape. Despite the overcast sky, the scene is vibrant, a snapshot of life in a busy city."}
