The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow on the scene. In the distance, buildings rise, their red and brown facades adding a touch of urbanity to the otherwise natural landscape.
