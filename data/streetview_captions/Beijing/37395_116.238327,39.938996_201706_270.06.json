The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees and shrubs, providing a vibrant contrast to the clear blue sky above. On the left side of the street, there's a stone wall, adding a rustic charm to the scene. On the right side, a lamp post stands tall, ready to illuminate the street as dusk falls. The image beautifully encapsulates the blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
