The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. Power lines crisscross above, adding a touch of urbanity to the otherwise natural landscape. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene and highlighting the textures of the trees and buildings."}
