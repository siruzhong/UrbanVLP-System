The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees and buildings, creating a harmonious blend of nature and architecture. The buildings, painted in shades of white and gray, rise majestically against the backdrop of a clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the green of the trees contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky."}
