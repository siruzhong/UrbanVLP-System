The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of looking up at the towering buildings and the clear blue sky. The buildings, painted in shades of white and gray, rise majestically on either side of the street, their windows reflecting the sunlight. The street itself is a hive of activity, with cars and buses moving along it, adding a dynamic element to the scene. On the right side of the street, trees and street lamps stand as silent observers to the city's hustle and bustle. The sky above is a vibrant blue, dotted with a few clouds, providing a beautiful backdrop to the urban landscape."}
