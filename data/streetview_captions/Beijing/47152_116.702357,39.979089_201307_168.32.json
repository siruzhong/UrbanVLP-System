The street, bathed in the soft glow of daylight, is flanked by lush green trees and bushes, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. On the left side of the street, a brick building stands tall, its red-brown hues adding a touch of warmth to the scene. A white fence runs along the right side of the street, providing a stark contrast to the brick building. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it, adding depth to the vast expanse. The perspective of the image suggests it was taken from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The image does not contain any text or discernible actions. The relative positions of the objects suggest a well-planned urban layout, with buildings, trees, and fences neatly arranged along the street. The image does not provide enough detail to confidently count the number of objects or identify specific types of objects. The colors in the image are predominantly green from the trees and bushes, brown from the brick building and fence, and blue from the sky. The image does not contain any imaginary content and all descriptions are based on the visible content of the image."}
