In the distance, several birds can be seen soaring in the sky, their silhouettes stark against the gray expanse of the sky. \n\nThe image does not contain any discernible text. The relative positions of the objects suggest a well-organized urban layout, with buildings, roads, and vehicles co-existing in harmony. The birds in the sky add a touch of nature to the urban setting. The image is a snapshot of everyday life in Beijing, capturing the city's architectural charm and the constant movement of its inhabitants."}
