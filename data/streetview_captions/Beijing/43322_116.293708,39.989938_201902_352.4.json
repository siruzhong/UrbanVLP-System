The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves forming a natural canopy overhead. Cars are parked neatly on the side of the road, adding a touch of modern life to the scene. In the distance, a tall building looms, its silhouette contrasting against the clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene and highlighting the vibrant colors of the cityscape."}
