The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene and creating a lens flare effect in the image. In the distance, a few buildings can be seen, their details softened by the distance. The overall color palette of the image is dominated by shades of green and blue, reflecting the natural and urban elements of the scene. The image does not contain any discernible text or specific actions being performed by objects. The relative positions of the objects suggest a quiet, possibly early morning or late afternoon, moment on this street in Beijing. The image does not provide enough detail to confidently count the number of objects or identify specific types of objects beyond those described. The image does not contain any content that cannot be confidently determined from the image itself. The description provided is based solely on the visible content of the image, without any assumptions or inferences about the unseen or imaginary content."}
