The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of depth and scale to the scene. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The street itself is lined with lush green trees, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. Power lines stretch across the sky, following the path of the street. In the distance, a bridge arches over the street, connecting two parts of the city. The buildings on either side of the street are painted in a variety of colors, adding a vibrant touch to the otherwise tranquil setting. The image beautifully encapsulates the blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
