The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly white and gray, punctuated by occasional blue and green accents that add a touch of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. The street itself is a hive of activity, with cars and buses moving along it, their colors muted under the overcast sky. On either side of the street, trees stand tall, their leaves forming a green canopy that contrasts with the urban landscape. Despite the overcast sky, the scene is vibrant and full of life, a snapshot of a city in motion."}
