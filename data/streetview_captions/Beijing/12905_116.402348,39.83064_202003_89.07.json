The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. Power lines crisscross above, adding a touch of urbanity to the otherwise natural landscape. Cars are parked neatly on the side of the road, hinting at the life and activity in this part of the city. In the distance, buildings rise, their silhouettes faint but unmistakable against the skyline. The image is a blend of nature and urban life, a snapshot of a moment in Beijing's daily rhythm."}
