The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings and trees that line the street. The buildings, predominantly white and gray, rise high into the sky, their glass facades reflecting the sunlight. The trees, with their bare branches, add a touch of nature to the urban landscape. The street itself is lined with cars and buses, indicating a busy time of day. The sky above is a clear blue, providing a vibrant backdrop to the scene."}
