The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the blue sky. Power lines crisscross above, adding a touch of urbanity to the otherwise natural landscape. Street lamps stand sentinel along the road, their presence hinting at the soft glow that would light up the street as dusk falls. In the distance, buildings rise, their silhouettes faint but discernible against the sky. The image is bathed in the warm glow of a sunset, casting long shadows and highlighting the textures of the trees and buildings."}
