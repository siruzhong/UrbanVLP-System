The perspective is from a high angle, providing a bird's eye view of the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees on both sides, creating a natural canopy overhead. The sky above is a clear blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds. The road itself is a dirt path, winding its way through the verdant landscape. On the right side of the road, there are a few buildings visible, their presence adding a touch of urbanity to the otherwise natural setting. The image does not contain any discernible text. The relative positions of the objects suggest a peaceful coexistence of nature and urban life in this part of Beijing. The image does not provide enough detail to confidently count the number of trees or buildings. The colors in the image are predominantly green from the trees, blue from the sky, and brown from the dirt road."}
