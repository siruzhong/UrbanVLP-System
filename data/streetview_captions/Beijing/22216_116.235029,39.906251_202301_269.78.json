Streetlights stand sentinel at regular intervals, ready to bathe the street in light as dusk falls. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the road, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city. Cars of different makes and models are scattered along the road, hinting at the city's active lifestyle.\n\nThe image is taken from a low angle, which emphasizes the height of the buildings and the expanse of the sky.
