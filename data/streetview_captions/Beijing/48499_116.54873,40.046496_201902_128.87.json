The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of depth and scale to the scene. The sky above is a clear blue, suggesting a bright and sunny day. On either side of the street, lush green trees stand tall, their leaves rustling in the unseen breeze. Buildings, mostly white and gray, line the street, their windows reflecting the sunlight. Cars are parked neatly on the side of the road, their metallic bodies gleaming under the sun. The image is bathed in the warm glow of the sun, casting long shadows and highlighting the textures of the buildings and trees."}
