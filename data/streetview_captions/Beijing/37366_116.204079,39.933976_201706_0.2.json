The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves forming a canopy that filters the sunlight, casting dappled shadows on the road below. Cars are parked neatly on the side of the road, their metallic bodies gleaming under the soft light. Buildings rise in the background, their facades adorned with windows and balconies, adding architectural interest to the scene. The colors in the image are predominantly green and gray, reflecting the natural and man-made elements of the landscape."}
