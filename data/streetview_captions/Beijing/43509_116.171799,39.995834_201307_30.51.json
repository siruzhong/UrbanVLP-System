The perspective is from a high angle, providing a bird's eye view of the scene. The street, lined with lush green trees and bushes, curves gently to the right, disappearing into the distance. A few cars are parked along the side of the road, adding a touch of urban life to the otherwise serene setting. The sky above is a clear blue, suggesting a bright and sunny day. In the background, mountains rise majestically, their peaks obscured by a smattering of clouds. The image beautifully captures the blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
