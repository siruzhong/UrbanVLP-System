The perspective is from the middle of the street, looking towards the horizon. The street is flanked by trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene. The street itself is devoid of any vehicles or pedestrians, giving it a serene and peaceful ambiance. The image does not contain any discernible text. The relative positions of the objects suggest a well-planned urban layout, with the trees neatly lining the street and the buildings maintaining a respectful distance. The image does not provide enough detail to confidently count the number of trees or buildings. The colors in the image are predominantly green (from the trees), blue (from the sky), and gray (from the buildings). The image does not contain any imaginary content. All descriptions are based on the visible content of the image."}
