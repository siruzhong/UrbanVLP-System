The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the buildings that line the street. The buildings, painted in shades of white and gray, stand tall against the backdrop of a clear blue sky. Their curved roofs add a unique architectural element to the cityscape.\n\nThe street itself is lined with lush green trees, providing a stark contrast to the urban environment. A few cars are parked along the side of the road, hinting at the daily life and activity in this part of the city. The sun shines brightly in the top left corner of the image, casting long shadows and illuminating the scene with a warm glow."}
