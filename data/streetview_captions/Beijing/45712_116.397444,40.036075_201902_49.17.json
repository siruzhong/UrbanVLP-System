The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with buildings on both sides, their gray and brown facades blending harmoniously with the urban landscape. Cars are parked neatly along the side of the road, adding a touch of modernity to the scene. In the middle of the street, a large tree stands tall, its green leaves contrasting beautifully with the surrounding concrete structures. The sky above is a clear blue, with a contrail visible in the distance, hinting at the presence of an airplane. The image is bathed in natural light, highlighting the colors and details of the scene."}
