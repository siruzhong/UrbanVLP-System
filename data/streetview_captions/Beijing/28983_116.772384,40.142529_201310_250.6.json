The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The sky is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The street itself is lined with lush green trees and bushes, adding a touch of nature to the urban landscape. On either side of the street, buildings rise, their facades reflecting the sunlight.
