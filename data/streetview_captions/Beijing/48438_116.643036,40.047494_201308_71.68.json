The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street, made of dirt, stretches out into the distance, flanked by buildings and trees on both sides. The buildings, painted in shades of white and gray, stand tall against the backdrop of a clear blue sky. The trees, lush and green, add a touch of nature to the urban landscape. In the distance, cranes can be seen, hinting at the ongoing development and progress in the city. The image is bathed in the warm glow of the sun, casting long shadows and highlighting the textures of the buildings and the street."}
