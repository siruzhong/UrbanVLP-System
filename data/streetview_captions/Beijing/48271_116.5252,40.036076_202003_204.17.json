The perspective is from a car on the road, giving a sense of motion and journey. The sky above is a clear blue, suggesting a bright and sunny day. On either side of the road, lush green trees stand tall, their leaves rustling in the wind. Power lines stretch across the scene, following the path of the road. Streetlights, standing like silent sentinels, punctuate the landscape at regular intervals. The sun shines brightly in the background, casting long shadows and bathing the scene in a warm glow. The image is a beautiful representation of a typical day in Beijing, with its blend of urban and natural elements."}
