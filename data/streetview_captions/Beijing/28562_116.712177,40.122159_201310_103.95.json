The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. A red car can be seen driving down the street, adding a pop of color to the otherwise green and blue landscape. The image is a beautiful representation of urban life in Beijing, with its blend of nature and cityscape."}
