The perspective is from a high vantage point, providing a bird's eye view of the scene below. The street, filled with cars and buses, stretches out into the distance, creating a sense of depth and scale. Buildings of various sizes and designs line the sides of the street, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city. Overhead, power lines crisscross the sky, adding another layer of complexity to the urban landscape. The sky above is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the scene."}
