The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly gray and white, punctuated by occasional red and green accents that add a touch of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. The street itself is a hive of activity, filled with cars and pedestrians going about their day. Overhead, power lines crisscross against the backdrop of a hazy sky, adding another layer of complexity to the urban landscape."}
