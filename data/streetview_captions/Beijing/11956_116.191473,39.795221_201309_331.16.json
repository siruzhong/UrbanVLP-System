The perspective is from a low angle, giving the viewer a sense of looking up at the towering trees that line both sides of the street. The trees are lush and green, their leaves forming a natural canopy overhead. The sky above is a clear blue, adding to the overall tranquility of the scene. In the distance, power lines stretch across the sky, a subtle reminder of urban life amidst the natural beauty. The image is slightly distorted due to the fisheye lens used, adding a unique perspective to the scene."}
