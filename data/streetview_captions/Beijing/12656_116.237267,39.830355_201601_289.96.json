The perspective is from a high vantage point, providing a bird's eye view of the scene below. The street, divided by a median, stretches out into the distance, flanked by tall buildings on both sides. The buildings, painted in shades of white and gray, rise majestically against the backdrop of a clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The street itself is devoid of any vehicles or pedestrians, adding a sense of tranquility to the otherwise busy cityscape."}
