The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The sky is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene.\n\nThe street itself is lined with lush green trees on both sides, their leaves rustling in the unseen breeze. On the right side of the street, power lines stretch into the distance, following the curve of the road. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city. Among them, a large billboard stands out, its bright colors contrasting with the muted tones of the surrounding structures.\n\nThe image is slightly distorted due to the fisheye lens effect, adding a unique perspective to the scene. Despite this distortion, the relative positions of the objects remain consistent, creating a harmonious balance in the composition of the image. The image does not contain any discernible text or specific actions being performed by objects. The overall scene is a blend of urban development and natural beauty, a characteristic feature of Beijing's cityscape."}
