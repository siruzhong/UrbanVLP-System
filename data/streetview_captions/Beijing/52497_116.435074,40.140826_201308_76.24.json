The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the scene. The sky is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly in the top left corner, casting a warm glow over the entire scene.\n\nOn either side of the street, there are lush green trees and bushes, adding a touch of nature to the urban setting. The buildings on the right side of the street are made of brick, their earthy tones contrasting with the vibrant greenery. On the left side of the street, there's a red building, its bold color standing out against the more muted tones of the brick buildings.\n\nThe street itself is lined with trees and bushes, creating a natural corridor that guides the viewer's eye through the image. The overall effect is a harmonious blend of urban and natural elements, a characteristic feature of Beijing's cityscape."}
