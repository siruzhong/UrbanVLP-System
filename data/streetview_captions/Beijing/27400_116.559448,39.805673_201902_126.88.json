The perspective is from a high angle, providing a bird's eye view of the street. The street itself is lined with lush green trees, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. A white car is parked on the side of the road, adding a touch of modernity to the otherwise tranquil setting. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The image beautifully encapsulates the blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
