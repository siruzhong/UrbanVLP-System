The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of the grandeur and scale of the cityscape. The street is lined with a variety of buildings, their facades painted in a palette of mostly white and beige, punctuated by occasional splashes of red and brown. Cars and buses are scattered along the road, hinting at the city's vibrant life and constant movement. The sky overhead is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the scene. In the distance, the tops of trees can be seen, adding a touch of nature to the urban landscape."}
