The perspective is from a pedestrian's viewpoint on the sidewalk, immersing the viewer in the city's daily life. The street is lined with a variety of buildings, their facades painted in a palette of mostly white and beige, punctuated by occasional splashes of red and green. Cars and buses traverse the road, adding a dynamic element to the scene. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun casting a bright light that illuminates the cityscape."}
