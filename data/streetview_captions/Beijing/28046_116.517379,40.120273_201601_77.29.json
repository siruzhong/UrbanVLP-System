Their stark silhouettes add a touch of winter's chill to the scene. On the right side, a building with a red and white facade catches the eye. A yellow crane perched on top hints at ongoing construction or renovation work.\n\nA yellow truck is parked on the right side of the street, adding a splash of color to the scene. Its presence suggests the hustle and bustle typical of city life. On the left side of the street, a white car is parked, its sleek form contrasting with the rough texture of the tree trunks.\n\nThe image is a snapshot of life in Beijing, capturing the city's blend of nature and architecture, movement and stillness.
