The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves forming a natural canopy overhead. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city. Cars are parked along the sides of the street, adding a touch of modern life to the scene. The sky above is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the entire scene. The colors in the image are mostly muted, creating a calm and serene atmosphere."}
