The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is flanked by buildings on both sides, their facades adorned with various signs and advertisements, hinting at the commercial nature of the area. Cars and buses traverse the street, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static urban landscape. The sky above is hazy, casting a soft light over the scene. In the distance, trees can be seen, providing a touch of nature amidst the concrete structures."}
