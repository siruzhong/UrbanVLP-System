The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The image is taken from a distance, allowing for a comprehensive view of the street and its surroundings. The colors in the image are vivid, with the green of the trees contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky. The image does not contain any text or discernible actions. The relative positions of the objects suggest a well-planned urban landscape, with the trees neatly lining the street and the buildings maintaining a respectful distance. The image does not provide enough detail to confidently count the number of objects or identify specific types of objects. The image is a testament to the harmonious coexistence of nature and urban development in Beijing."}
