The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene. The street below is a hive of activity, filled with cars and buses in motion, their colors muted under the bright sunlight. Buildings of various sizes and designs line the street, their facades reflecting the sunlight. Overhead, power lines crisscross the sky, forming an intricate web against the backdrop of the blue sky. The image is taken from a low angle, giving a unique perspective that emphasizes the height of the buildings and the expanse of the sky."}
