The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of grandeur to the towering buildings that line the street.

On either side of the street, lush greenery provides a refreshing contrast to the urban landscape. Trees and bushes are interspersed between the buildings, their leaves a vibrant splash of green against the concrete and glass backdrop.\n\nThe image is bathed in the warm glow of a sunny day, the sunlight casting long shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings. The overall effect is a harmonious blend of urban development and natural beauty, a characteristic feature of Beijing's cityscape."}
