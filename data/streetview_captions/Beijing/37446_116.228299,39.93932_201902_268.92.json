The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the surroundings. The street is lined with bare trees, their branches reaching out into the clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene. Power lines crisscross above, adding a touch of urbanity to the otherwise natural landscape. In the distance, buildings rise, their silhouettes faint against the bright sky. The image is bathed in the light of day, highlighting the colors and details of the scene."}
