The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves forming a canopy over the road. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades bathed in sunlight. The sky above is a clear blue, with a smattering of clouds adding depth to the background. The image is slightly distorted due to the fisheye lens effect, adding a unique perspective to the urban landscape."}
