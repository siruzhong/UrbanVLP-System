The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of the towering buildings that line the street. These structures, primarily made of brick and glass, rise high into the sky, their facades reflecting the sunlight. The street itself is a hive of activity with cars and buses moving along it, adding a dynamic element to the scene. On either side of the street, trees and bushes provide a touch of greenery, contrasting with the urban landscape. The sky above is a clear blue, dotted with a few clouds, completing the picture of a typical day in this vibrant city."}
