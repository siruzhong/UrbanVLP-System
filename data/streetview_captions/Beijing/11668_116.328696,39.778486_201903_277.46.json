The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades bathed in sunlight. The sun, positioned in the top right corner of the image, casts a bright light that illuminates the scene, adding depth and contrast to the image. The overall effect is a harmonious blend of urban architecture and natural elements, a characteristic feature of Beijing's cityscape."}
