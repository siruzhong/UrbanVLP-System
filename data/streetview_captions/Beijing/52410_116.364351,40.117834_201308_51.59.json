The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees on both sides, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene.
