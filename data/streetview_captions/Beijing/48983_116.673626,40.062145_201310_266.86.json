The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The road itself is made of asphalt and appears to be in good condition. On the right side of the road, there are buildings visible, their details slightly obscured by the distance. The image does not contain any discernible text. The relative positions of the objects suggest a well-planned urban landscape, with the buildings neatly aligned along the road and the trees providing a natural border. The image does not provide enough detail to confidently count the number of trees or buildings. The colors in the image are predominantly green from the trees, blue from the sky, and gray from the road and buildings. The sun's position suggests it might be either early morning or late afternoon. The image does not contain any people or moving objects, giving it a serene and peaceful atmosphere."}
