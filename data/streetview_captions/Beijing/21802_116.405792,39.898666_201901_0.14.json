The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly white and gray, punctuated by occasional blue and green accents that add a touch of color to the urban landscape. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene. The street itself is lined with trees, providing a touch of greenery amidst the concrete structures. Cars can be seen driving on the road, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static cityscape."}
