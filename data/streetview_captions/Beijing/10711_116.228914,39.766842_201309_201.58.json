The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The sky is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly in the top right corner, casting a warm glow over the entire scene.\n\nOn the left side of the street, there are power lines stretching into the distance, following the curve of the road. These lines add a touch of urbanity to the otherwise natural landscape. On the right side, there are trees and shrubs, their green foliage contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky.\n\nIn the center of the image, there's a white pole standing tall. This could be a street lamp or a traffic sign, adding another layer of detail to the scene. The overall composition of the image creates a harmonious blend of urban and natural elements, typical of Beijing's cityscape."}
