The perspective is from the middle of the street, looking towards the horizon, giving a sense of depth and scale to the scene. The street is lined with modern buildings, their facades predominantly white and gray, punctuated by occasional blue and green accents that add a touch of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. The buildings rise high into the hazy sky, their tops disappearing into the mist. The street itself is devoid of any human presence, adding a sense of tranquility amidst the urban landscape. On the left side of the street, a few trees and bushes can be seen, their greenery providing a stark contrast to the concrete structures. The image does not contain any discernible text or specific actions being performed by objects. The relative positions of the objects suggest a well-planned urban layout, with buildings, trees, and roads all neatly aligned. The image does not provide enough detail to confidently count the number of objects or describe their precise locations. Overall, the image presents a serene yet vibrant snapshot of urban life in Beijing."}
