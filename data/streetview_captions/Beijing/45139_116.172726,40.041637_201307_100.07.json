The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees and buildings, creating a harmonious blend of nature and architecture. The colors in the image are predominantly green and gray, reflecting the typical urban landscape of Beijing. The sky, visible in the top left corner of the image, adds a touch of blue to the otherwise monochromatic palette. The image is slightly distorted due to the fisheye lens effect, adding a unique perspective to the viewer's experience."}
