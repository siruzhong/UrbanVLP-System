The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades bathed in sunlight. A few cars can be seen driving down the road, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static scene. The sun shines brightly overhead, casting long shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings."}
