The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves forming a natural canopy overhead. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The image is captured using a fisheye lens, which distorts the edges of the frame, adding a unique perspective to the photograph."}
