The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the buildings that line the street. These structures are adorned with vibrant signs and advertisements, adding a splash of color to the urban landscape. The street itself is a hive of activity, filled with cars and pedestrians going about their day. Overhead, power lines crisscross the sky, a common sight in many cityscapes. The sky above is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the scene."}
