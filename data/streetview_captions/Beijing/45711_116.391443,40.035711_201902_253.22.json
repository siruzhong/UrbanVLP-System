The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves forming a natural canopy overhead. The buildings, painted in shades of white and gray, stand tall against the backdrop of a clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene."}
