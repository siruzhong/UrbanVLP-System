The perspective is from a high angle, providing a bird's eye view of the scene. The street, divided by a median, stretches out into the distance, flanked by buildings and trees on both sides. The buildings, painted in shades of white and gray, rise up against the backdrop of a clear blue sky. The trees, lush and green, add a touch of nature to the urban landscape. Streetlights stand sentinel along the road, ready to illuminate the path as dusk falls. Power lines crisscross above, forming a network that connects the city. The image is bathed in the light of a sunny day, casting long shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings. The overall scene is a blend of urban development and natural beauty, a characteristic feature of Beijing's cityscape."}
