They are part of the iconic landmark, the Temple of Heaven, a symbol of China's rich history and architectural prowess. The domes, with their intricate patterns and vibrant colors, provide a stark contrast to the natural elements in the scene.\n\nOn the left side of the image, a road stretches into the distance, hinting at the bustling city life that surrounds this serene spot. The road, the domes, and the tree together create a harmonious blend of nature, history, and urban life in Beijing.
