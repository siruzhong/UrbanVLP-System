The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. A few people can be seen walking on the sidewalk, adding a touch of life to the scene. In the distance, a large concrete overpass looms, its presence a testament to the city's architectural prowess. The overall color palette is dominated by shades of green from the trees, blue from the sky, and gray from the concrete structures. The image beautifully captures the blend of nature and urban development in Beijing."}
