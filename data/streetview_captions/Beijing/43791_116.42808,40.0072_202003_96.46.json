The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves rustling in the unseen breeze, providing a vibrant contrast to the clear blue sky above. Street lamps stand sentinel along the sides of the road, their presence hinting at the soft glow that would light up the street as dusk falls. Cars are parked neatly on the side of the road, their metallic bodies gleaming under the sunlight. Buildings rise in the background, their windows reflecting the world around them. The image is bathed in the warm glow of daylight, casting long shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings."}
