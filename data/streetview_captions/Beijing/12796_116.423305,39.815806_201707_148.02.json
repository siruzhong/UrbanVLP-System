The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly white and gray, punctuated by occasional brown and green accents, reflecting the urban architectural style of the city. The street itself is a hive of activity, with cars and buses moving along its length, adding a dynamic element to the scene. On the right side of the street, trees and bushes provide a touch of nature amidst the concrete jungle. The sky overhead is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the scene."}
