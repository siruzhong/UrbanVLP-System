The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees and shrubs, their leaves vibrant and full of life. A stone wall runs along the right side of the street, adding a touch of rustic charm to the urban landscape.
