The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves forming a natural canopy overhead. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades bathed in the warm glow of the sun. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting long shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the green of the trees contrasting against the blue of the sky and the varied hues of the buildings."}
