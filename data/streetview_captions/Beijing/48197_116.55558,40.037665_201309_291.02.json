On the right side of the road, there are several cars moving along, their colors muted under the bright sunlight. \n\nOn the left side of the road, a solitary car is parked, perhaps belonging to a driver taking a break from their journey. In the distance, a sign for a toll station can be seen, a common sight on highways in many countries. \n\nThe image is a snapshot of a typical day on a highway in Beijing, capturing the hustle and bustle of life on the road.
