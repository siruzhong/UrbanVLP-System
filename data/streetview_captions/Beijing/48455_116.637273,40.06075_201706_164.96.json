The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves forming a canopy overhead, providing shade and a touch of nature amidst the urban setting. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it, adding to the overall serene atmosphere of the scene. The image does not contain any discernible text or specific actions being performed by objects. The relative positions of the objects suggest a well-planned urban layout, with buildings, trees, and the street all neatly aligned. The image does not provide enough detail to confidently count the number of objects or identify specific colors. The image is a testament to the harmonious coexistence of nature and urban development in Beijing."}
