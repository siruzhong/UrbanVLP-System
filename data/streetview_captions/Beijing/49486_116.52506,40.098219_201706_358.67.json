The street, bathed in the warm glow of the sun, is flanked by lush green trees on both sides, creating a natural canopy. The buildings, painted in shades of gray and brown, stand tall against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. The sun, positioned in the top left corner of the image, casts long shadows of the trees onto the street, adding depth to the scene. The image is captured from a low angle, making the buildings appear as if they are reaching towards the sky. The overall perspective gives a sense of depth and scale, immersing the viewer in the urban landscape of Beijing."}
