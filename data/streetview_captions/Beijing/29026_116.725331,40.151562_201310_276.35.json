The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves forming a canopy overhead. The buildings on either side of the street are white, their red roofs adding a pop of color to the scene. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene."}
