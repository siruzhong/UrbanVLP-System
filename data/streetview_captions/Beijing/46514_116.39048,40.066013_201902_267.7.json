The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. A few people can be seen walking on the sidewalk, adding a touch of life to the otherwise still image. Cars are parked neatly on the side of the road, their metallic bodies gleaming under the sunlight. The image beautifully encapsulates a typical day in Beijing, with its blend of urban life and natural beauty."}
