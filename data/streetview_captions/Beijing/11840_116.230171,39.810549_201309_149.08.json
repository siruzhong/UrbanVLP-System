The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The sky is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly in the top left corner, casting a warm glow over the landscape. \n\nThe street itself is lined with trees and shrubs on both sides, their green hues contrasting with the blue of the sky. The road curves gently to the right, disappearing into the distance, inviting the viewer to imagine where it might lead. \n\nIn the far distance, the silhouette of mountains can be seen, adding depth and a sense of scale to the image. The overall effect is a harmonious blend of natural and man-made elements, a characteristic feature of Beijing's landscape."}
