The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of the scale and activity of the site. The main focus is a large building under construction, its blue and white facade standing out against the backdrop of other buildings. A crane, a common sight at such sites, is visible in the background, indicating ongoing work. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it, suggesting a bright and sunny day."}
