The street, bathed in the warm glow of the sun, stretches out ahead, flanked by trees and buildings on both sides. The sky above is a clear blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds. The sun, positioned in the top left corner of the image, casts a bright light that illuminates the scene. The perspective of the image is from a low angle, looking down the length of the street, giving a sense of depth and distance. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the green of the trees contrasting against the blue of the sky."}
