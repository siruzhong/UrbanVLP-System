The perspective is from a pedestrian's viewpoint on the sidewalk, immersing the viewer in the city's daily life. The street is lined with lush green trees, providing a stark contrast to the urban buildings that flank it. These buildings, predominantly white and gray, rise high into the sky, their facades adorned with vibrant billboards and advertisements that add a splash of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. The sky above is a clear blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds, casting a bright light that illuminates the scene. The image is taken from a low angle, which emphasizes the height of the buildings and gives the viewer a sense of being part of the city's hustle and bustle."}
