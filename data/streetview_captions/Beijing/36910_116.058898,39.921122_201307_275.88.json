The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. A stone wall, weathered by time, runs along the left side of the street, adding a rustic charm to the urban landscape. On the right side of the street, lush green trees and bushes provide a vibrant contrast to the stone wall. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly in the top right corner, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. In the distance, mountains rise against the sky, adding depth and a sense of vastness to the image. The image is a beautiful blend of urban and natural elements, showcasing the harmonious coexistence of man-made structures and nature in Beijing."}
