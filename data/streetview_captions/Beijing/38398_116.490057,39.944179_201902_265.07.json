The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves rustling in the breeze, providing a stark contrast to the clear blue sky above. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city. Overhead, power lines crisscross the sky, a common sight in urban landscapes. People can be seen walking on the sidewalk, going about their day, adding a touch of life to the scene. The image is bathed in the warm glow of the sun, casting long shadows and highlighting the textures of the buildings and trees."}
