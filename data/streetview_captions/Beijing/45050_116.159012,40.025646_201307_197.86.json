The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the surroundings. The street is flanked by trees on both sides, their leaves forming a lush green canopy overhead. Power lines crisscross above, adding a touch of urbanity to the otherwise natural landscape. In the distance, mountains rise majestically, their peaks obscured by a hazy sky. The colors in the image are predominantly green and gray, reflecting the harmonious blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
