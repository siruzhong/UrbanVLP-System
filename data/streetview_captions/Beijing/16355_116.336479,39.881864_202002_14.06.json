The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly white and gray, punctuated by occasional red and blue accents that add a splash of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. The sky above is a clear blue, with a smattering of clouds adding depth to the scene. The street itself is lined with trees, their green leaves contrasting with the urban landscape. Cars and buses are parked along the side of the road, hinting at the daily life and activity in this part of the city."}
