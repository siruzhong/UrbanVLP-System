The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is flanked by buildings on both sides, their architecture hinting at the rich history of the city. A large overpass stretches across the street, a testament to the city's modern infrastructure. Cars and buses traverse the road, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static urban landscape.
