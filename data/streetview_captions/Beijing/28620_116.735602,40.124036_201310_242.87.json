The perspective is from a car on the road, giving a driver's eye view of the scene. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly in the top right corner, casting a warm glow over the scene. The road itself is divided into two lanes, separated by a median. On the left side of the road, there are trees and bushes, adding a touch of green to the otherwise urban landscape. On the right side, there's a row of street lamps standing tall, ready to illuminate the road as dusk falls. The image beautifully encapsulates a typical day on a highway in Beijing, with its blend of urban and natural elements."}
