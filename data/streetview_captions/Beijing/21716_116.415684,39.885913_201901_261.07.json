The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with buildings on both sides, their facades adorned with red lanterns that add a vibrant splash of color to the urban landscape. The sky above is a clear blue, and the sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The image is slightly distorted due to the fisheye lens effect, adding a unique perspective to the photograph."}
