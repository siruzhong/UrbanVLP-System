The perspective is from a high angle, providing a bird's eye view of the scene. The street, divided by a median, stretches out into the distance, flanked by trees on both sides. These trees, bare of leaves, stand tall against the backdrop of a hazy sky. A few cars are parked along the side of the road, adding a touch of urban life to the otherwise serene landscape. The colors in the image are muted, with the green of the trees contrasting with the gray of the road and the hazy blue of the sky."}
