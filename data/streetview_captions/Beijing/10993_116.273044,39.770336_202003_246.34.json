The perspective is from a car on the road, giving a sense of motion and journey. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene. On either side of the road, lush green trees stand tall, their leaves rustling in the breeze. Power lines stretch across the sky, following the curve of the road. In the distance, a few buildings can be seen, their silhouettes faint against the bright sky. The image is taken from a low angle, making the viewer feel as if they are right there on the road, experiencing the sights and sounds of Beijing."}
