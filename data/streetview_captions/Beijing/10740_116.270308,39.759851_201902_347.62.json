The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. In the distance, buildings rise, their details softened by the perspective. The colors in the image are rich and natural, with the green of the trees contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky."}
