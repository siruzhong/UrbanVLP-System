The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves forming a natural canopy overhead. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city. The sky above is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the scene. The colors in the image are mostly muted, creating a calm and serene atmosphere. However, the greenery stands out, adding a touch of vibrancy to the otherwise subdued palette."}
