The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with buildings and trees, their colors muted under the clear blue sky. Power lines crisscross above, adding a touch of urbanity to the scene. In the distance, a bridge stretches across the river, connecting two parts of the city. The image is bathed in the warm glow of the sun, casting long shadows and highlighting the textures of the buildings and trees."}
