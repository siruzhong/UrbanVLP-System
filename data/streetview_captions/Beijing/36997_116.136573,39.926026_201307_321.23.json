The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings that line the street. These structures, painted in shades of gray and white, rise high into the clear blue sky. The street itself is a hive of activity with cars and buses moving along its length, adding a dynamic element to the scene. In the distance, a bridge stretches across the street, connecting different parts of the city. The lush greenery of trees and bushes provides a stark contrast to the urban landscape, adding a touch of nature to the cityscape."}
