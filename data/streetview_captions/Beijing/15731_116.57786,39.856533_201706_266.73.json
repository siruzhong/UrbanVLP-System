The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of the grandeur and scale of the cityscape. The street is lined with lush green trees, providing a stark contrast to the urban buildings that flank it on both sides. The buildings, predominantly white and gray, rise high into the overcast sky, their monotone palette punctuated by occasional splashes of red and blue. The street itself is a hive of activity, with cars and motorcycles moving along its length, adding a dynamic element to the scene. Despite the overcast sky, the image exudes a sense of vibrancy and life, characteristic of a thriving metropolis like Beijing."}
