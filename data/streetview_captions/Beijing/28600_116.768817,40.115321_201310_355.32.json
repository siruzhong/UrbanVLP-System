The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves rustling in the breeze, casting dappled shadows on the pavement. On the right side of the street, there's a white building with a red roof, standing out against the clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, its rays filtering through the leaves of the trees, creating a kaleidoscope of light and shadow on the ground. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the green of the trees contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky. The image captures the essence of a sunny day in Beijing, with its blend of natural beauty and architectural charm."}
