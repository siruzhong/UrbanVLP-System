The perspective is from the center of the street, looking towards the horizon. The street is flanked by trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene. The street itself is divided into two lanes by a white line, and a sidewalk runs parallel to it on the right side. The image is captured from a low angle, adding a sense of depth and perspective to the scene."}
