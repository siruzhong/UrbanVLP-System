The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of the towering buildings that line the street. These structures, primarily made of concrete and glass, rise high into the sky, their facades reflecting the sunlight. The street itself is a hive of activity, with cars and buses moving along its length, adding a dynamic element to the scene. On either side of the street, trees provide a touch of nature amidst the urban landscape. In the distance, construction cranes can be seen, hinting at the ongoing development and growth in the city. The image is bathed in the warm glow of the sun, casting long shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings."}
