The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the buildings and trees that line the street. The buildings, painted in shades of white and beige, stand tall against the backdrop of a clear blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds. The trees, stripped of their leaves, add a stark contrast to the urban landscape. The street itself is devoid of any human presence, adding a sense of tranquility to the scene. The image is bathed in the soft light of day, highlighting the architectural details of the buildings and the natural beauty of the trees."}
