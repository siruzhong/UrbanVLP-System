The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The sky above is a clear blue, providing a stark contrast to the red and white buses that are parked neatly in rows. These buses, with their vibrant colors, add a pop of color to the otherwise monochrome setting. In the background, tall buildings stretch towards the sky, their towering presence a testament to the urban landscape of Beijing. The image is bathed in the light of a sunny day, casting long shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings."}
