The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the image. The street is flanked by trees on both sides, their bare branches reaching out into the clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene. A white car is parked on the right side of the street, adding a touch of modern life to the otherwise tranquil setting. The image beautifully encapsulates the blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
