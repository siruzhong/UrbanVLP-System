The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with buildings on both sides, their architecture hinting at the blend of modern and traditional styles that are characteristic of Beijing. The buildings are bathed in the warm glow of the sun, casting long shadows that stretch across the street. The sky above is a clear blue, providing a striking contrast to the earthy tones of the buildings. In the distance, the tops of trees can be seen, adding a touch of nature to the urban landscape."}
