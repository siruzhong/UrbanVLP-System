The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings and the clear blue sky. The buildings, predominantly white and gray, rise high into the sky, their facades adorned with red and gold accents that add a touch of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. The street below is a hive of activity, lined with trees that provide a green canopy over the urban landscape. Red lanterns hang from the trees, swaying gently in the breeze, adding a festive touch to the scene. The sun shines brightly in the blue sky, casting long shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings."}
