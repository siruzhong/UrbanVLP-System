The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with buildings on both sides, their facades bathed in the warm glow of the setting sun. Trees dot the landscape, adding a touch of green to the urban setting. Streetlights stand sentinel along the road, their presence hinting at the transition from day to night. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it, adding depth to the expansive view. The image is bathed in the soft light of the setting sun, casting long shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings."}
