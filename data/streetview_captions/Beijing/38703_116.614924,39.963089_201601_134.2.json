The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. Streetlights stand sentinel along the road, their presence hinting at the transformation of the scene as day turns to night. In the distance, buildings rise, their details softened by the distance. The image is bathed in the warm glow of a sunny day, the sunlight casting long shadows and highlighting the textures of the trees and buildings. The overall effect is a harmonious blend of urban architecture and natural elements, a characteristic feature of Beijing's cityscape."}
