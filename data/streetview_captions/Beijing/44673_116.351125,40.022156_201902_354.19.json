The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves rustling in the breeze, providing a canopy over the road. Cars are parked neatly on the side of the road, their metallic bodies gleaming under the sunlight. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city. The sky above is a clear blue, with a smattering of clouds adding depth to the vast expanse."}
