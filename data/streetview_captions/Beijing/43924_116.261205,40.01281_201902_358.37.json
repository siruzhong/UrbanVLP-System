The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the overcast sky. The buildings in the background, mostly white and gray, add a touch of urbanity to the otherwise natural landscape. The colors in the image are muted, with the green of the trees and the gray of the buildings blending into a harmonious palette. The overcast sky adds a soft light to the scene, enhancing the overall mood of the image."}
