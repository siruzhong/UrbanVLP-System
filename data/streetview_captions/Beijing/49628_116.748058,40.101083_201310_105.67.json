The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees on both sides, their leaves forming a canopy overhead. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it. The road itself is mostly empty, with only a few cars and a bus visible, adding a touch of life to the otherwise serene setting. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the green of the trees contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky."}
