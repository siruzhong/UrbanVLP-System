The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly white and gray, punctuated by occasional red and green accents that add a touch of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. The sky above is a clear blue, with wispy clouds scattered across it. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene. The street itself is lined with trees and lampposts, adding a sense of order and symmetry to the urban landscape."}
