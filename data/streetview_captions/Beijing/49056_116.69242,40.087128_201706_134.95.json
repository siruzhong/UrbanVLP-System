The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees on both sides, their leaves forming a canopy overhead. Cars are parked neatly on the side of the road, adding a touch of urban life to the otherwise serene setting. The sky above is a clear blue, and the sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene."}
