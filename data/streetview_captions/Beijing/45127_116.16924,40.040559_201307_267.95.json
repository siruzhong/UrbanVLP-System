The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly made of brick and concrete, their facades adorned with vibrant signs and advertisements that add a splash of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. Overhead, power lines crisscross the sky, a common sight in urban landscapes. The street itself is lined with trees, providing a touch of nature amidst the concrete jungle. Cars and bicycles are parked along the side of the road, hinting at the daily life and activity in this part of the city."}
