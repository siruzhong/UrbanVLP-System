The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. Cars are parked neatly on the side of the road, adding a touch of everyday life to the scene. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire landscape and creating a lens flare in the top left corner of the image."}
