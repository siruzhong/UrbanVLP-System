The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades bathed in sunlight. The sun's rays filter through the trees, casting dappled shadows on the pavement. The colors in the image are predominantly blue, green, and brown, reflecting the natural and man-made elements of the scene."}
