The road, divided by a median, is flanked by lush green trees and bushes on both sides, creating a serene and tranquil atmosphere. The sun, positioned in the top left corner of the image, casts a bright light that illuminates the scene, highlighting the vibrant colors of the landscape. The perspective of the image is from a low angle, looking down the road towards the horizon, giving a sense of depth and distance. The image does not contain any text or discernible actions. The relative positions of the objects remain constant, with the road centrally located, the trees and bushes on either side, and the sun in the top left corner.
