The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly gray and white, punctuated by occasional brown and green accents, reflecting the urban landscape of the city. The street itself is a hive of activity, with cars and buses moving along its length, adding a dynamic element to the scene. The sky overhead is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the scene."}
