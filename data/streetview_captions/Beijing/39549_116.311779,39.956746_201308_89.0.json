The perspective is from a pedestrian's viewpoint on the sidewalk, immersing the viewer in the city's daily life. The street is bustling with activity, lined with lush green trees that provide a refreshing contrast to the urban landscape. Modern buildings rise in the background, their glass facades reflecting the clear blue sky.
