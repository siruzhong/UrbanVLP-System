The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees and buildings, creating a harmonious blend of urban and natural elements. Cars are parked along the side of the road, adding a touch of modern life to the scene. Power lines crisscross above, connecting the buildings and adding a geometric contrast to the organic shapes of the trees and buildings.
