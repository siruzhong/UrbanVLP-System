The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves forming a natural canopy over the road. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades bathed in the warm glow of the sun. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting long shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings."}
