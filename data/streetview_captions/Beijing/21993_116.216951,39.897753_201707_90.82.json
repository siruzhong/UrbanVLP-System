The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees and buildings, creating a harmonious blend of nature and architecture. The buildings, painted in shades of green and pink, add a vibrant touch to the otherwise serene setting. The sky above is a clear blue, dotted with a few clouds, adding depth to the image. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene."}
