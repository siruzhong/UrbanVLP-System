The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with buildings and trees, their colors muted under the bright sunlight. Power lines crisscross above, creating a network of lines against the sky. The sun shines brightly in the background, casting a warm glow over the scene."}
