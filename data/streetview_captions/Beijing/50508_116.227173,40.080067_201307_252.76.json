The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees on both sides, their leaves rustling in the unseen breeze. On the right side of the street, a large white building stands out, its curved facade adding a unique architectural element to the cityscape. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene."}
