The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with tall buildings and trees, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. The buildings, painted in shades of brown and beige, rise majestically, while the trees add a touch of nature to the urban landscape. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow on the scene and highlighting the textures of the buildings and trees."}
