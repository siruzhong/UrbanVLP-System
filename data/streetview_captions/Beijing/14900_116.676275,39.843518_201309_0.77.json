The street, bathed in the soft glow of daylight, is flanked by lush green trees on both sides, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. A red car, vibrant against the muted colors of the surroundings, is parked on the right side of the street, adding a pop of color to the scene. The sky above is a clear blue, with a smattering of clouds dotting the horizon. The perspective of the image is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the scene."}
