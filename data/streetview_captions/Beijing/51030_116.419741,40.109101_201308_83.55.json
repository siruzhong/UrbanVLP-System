The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The sky is a clear blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene.\n\nThe street itself is lined with lush green trees, their leaves rustling in the breeze. On the left side of the street, there's a large concrete wall, its gray color contrasting with the vibrant greenery. On the right side, a row of buildings stands tall, their facades adorned with balconies that overlook the street.\n\nThe image is captured using a fisheye lens, which gives it a distorted circular border. This effect adds an artistic touch to the image, making it stand out. Despite the distortion, the image faithfully captures the essence of the street in Beijing, providing a glimpse into the city's daily life."}
