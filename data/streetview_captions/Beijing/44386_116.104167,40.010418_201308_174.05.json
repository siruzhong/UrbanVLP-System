The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees on both sides, their leaves forming a natural canopy overhead. On the right side of the street, there's a large white building with a curved roof, standing out against the blue sky. The building's architecture suggests it could be a significant landmark. The sky itself is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it, adding depth to the image. The overall color palette is dominated by shades of green from the trees, white from the building, and blue from the sky. The image does not contain any discernible text or countable objects. The relative positions of the objects suggest a well-planned urban layout, with the building and trees neatly aligned along the street."}
