The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves forming a natural canopy over the road. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city. The sky above is a clear blue, with a smattering of clouds adding depth to the background. The colors in the image are predominantly green from the trees, gray from the buildings, and blue from the sky, creating a harmonious palette that is typical of a sunny day in Beijing."}
