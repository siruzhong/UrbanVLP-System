The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees on both sides, their leaves forming a natural canopy overhead. Cars are parked neatly along the side of the road, adding a touch of modernity to the otherwise serene setting. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The image beautifully captures the blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
