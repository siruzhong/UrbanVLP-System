The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and depth to the scene. The street is lined with white buildings, their facades adorned with colorful graffiti, adding a touch of urban artistry to the cityscape. Power lines crisscross above, connecting the buildings and creating a network of lines against the blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting shadows and highlighting the details of the buildings and the graffiti."}
