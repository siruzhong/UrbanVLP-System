The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees and buildings, creating a harmonious blend of urban and natural elements. The buildings, painted in shades of white and gray, stand tall against the backdrop of a clear blue sky. In the distance, a large metal structure looms, adding a touch of modernity to the otherwise traditional architecture. The image is bathed in the warm glow of a sunny day, with shadows subtly hinting at the time of day."}
