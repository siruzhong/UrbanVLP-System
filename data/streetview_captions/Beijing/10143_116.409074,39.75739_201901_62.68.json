The perspective is from the middle of the street, looking down its length. On either side of the street, there are bare trees standing tall, their branches reaching out into the clear blue sky. The street itself is lined with power lines, running parallel to it. On the left side of the street, there's a construction site, covered with a green tarp. The image is captured from a low angle, giving a sense of depth and perspective to the scene. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the green of the trees contrasting against the blue sky. The overall scene gives a glimpse into the urban landscape of Beijing."}
