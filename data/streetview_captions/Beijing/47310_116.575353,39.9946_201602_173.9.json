The perspective is from the middle of the street, looking down towards the horizon. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly in the top right corner. The street itself is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades bathed in sunlight. Power lines crisscross above, creating a network of lines against the sky. The image is taken from a low angle, giving a sense of depth and perspective to the scene."}
