The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with buildings on both sides, their gray and white facades reflecting the urban architecture of the city. Cars are parked neatly along the side of the road, adding a touch of everyday life to the scene.
