The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the image. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. A car is parked on the side of the road, its presence adding a touch of modernity to the otherwise serene setting. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it, adding to the overall calmness of the scene.
