The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with power lines and telephone poles, a common sight in many urban areas. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades hinting at the architectural diversity of the city. The sky above is hazy, casting a soft light over the scene.
