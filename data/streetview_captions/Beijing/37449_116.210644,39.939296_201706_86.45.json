The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. A blue fence runs parallel to the street, adding a pop of color to the scene. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. In the distance, you can see people strolling along the sidewalk, adding a touch of life to the otherwise tranquil setting. The image beautifully encapsulates the blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
