The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees and shrubs, creating a canopy of greenery that contrasts beautifully with the clear blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. A black car is parked on the side of the road, adding a touch of modernity to the otherwise natural landscape. In the distance, a building with a red roof peeks out, hinting at the urban life that surrounds this tranquil street."}
