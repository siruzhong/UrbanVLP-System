The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees and buildings, creating a harmonious blend of nature and architecture. The buildings, predominantly white and gray, rise majestically against the backdrop of a clear blue sky. The greenery along the street adds a touch of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. The image is bathed in the warm glow of a sunny day, casting soft shadows and highlighting the textures of the buildings and trees."}
