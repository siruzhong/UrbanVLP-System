The perspective is from a high vantage point, providing a bird's eye view of the scene below. The street, divided by a concrete median, stretches out into the distance, flanked by lush green trees on one side and a variety of buildings on the other. \n\nVehicles, including cars and buses, traverse the road, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static urban landscape.
