The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of a clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow on the scene. In the distance, power lines stretch across the sky, adding a touch of urbanity to the otherwise natural landscape. The image beautifully captures the blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
