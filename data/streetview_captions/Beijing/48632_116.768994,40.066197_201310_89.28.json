The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow on the scene. On the right side of the street, buildings rise, their details softened by the distance. A few people can be seen walking on the sidewalk, adding a touch of life to the scene. The image is a beautiful representation of a typical day in Beijing, with its blend of natural beauty and urban architecture."}
