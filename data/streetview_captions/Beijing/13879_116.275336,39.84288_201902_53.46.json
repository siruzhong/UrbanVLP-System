The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the buildings that line the street. These structures are primarily made of brick and concrete, their facades adorned with vibrant red and gold decorations that add a splash of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. \n\nThe street itself is a hive of activity, with people and vehicles moving about, adding a dynamic element to the scene. Overhead, power lines crisscross against the backdrop of a clear blue sky, a common sight in many urban areas."}
