The perspective is from the middle of the street, looking down its length towards the horizon. The street is flanked on both sides by lush green trees and bushes, creating a natural canopy overhead. The sky above is a clear blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds. The road itself is a solid gray, marked with white lines that guide the way. The image is taken from a low angle, making the viewer feel as if they are standing right there on the street, looking up at the sky. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the green of the trees contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky."}
