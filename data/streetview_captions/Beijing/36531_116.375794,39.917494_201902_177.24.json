The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves forming a natural canopy overhead. Buildings of various architectural styles flank the street, their facades bathed in the warm glow of the sun. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun casting a bright light that illuminates the scene."}
