The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees and buildings, their details softened by the hazy sky. Power lines crisscross above, adding a touch of urbanity to the otherwise natural landscape. The colors in the image are muted, with shades of green from the trees contrasting with the grey of the buildings and the sky."}
