The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly gray and white, punctuated by occasional red and green accents that add a touch of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene. The street itself is lined with trees and lampposts, adding a sense of order and structure to the urban landscape. Cars and buses are parked along the side of the road, hinting at the city's constant movement and energy."}
