The street, divided into two lanes by a median, stretches out into the distance, flanked by trees and bushes on both sides. A sidewalk runs parallel to the street, providing a path for pedestrians. On the right side of the street, a blue sign stands out, although the text on it is not visible in the image. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it. The image is captured from a low angle, giving a sense of depth and perspective to the scene. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the green of the trees and bushes contrasting against the blue of the sky."}
