The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with buildings and trees, creating a harmonious blend of urban and natural elements. The buildings, painted in shades of white and gray, stand tall against the backdrop of a clear blue sky. The trees, on the other hand, add a touch of green to the otherwise monochrome palette. The image is bathed in the warm glow of the setting sun, casting long shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings."}
