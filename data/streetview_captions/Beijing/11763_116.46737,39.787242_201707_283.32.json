The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings that line the street. These structures, predominantly beige and brown, rise high into the overcast sky, their windows reflecting the muted light of the day. The street itself is a hive of activity, with cars and buses moving along its length, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static cityscape. On the right side of the street, construction barriers can be seen, hinting at the ongoing development and progress in the city. Despite the overcast sky, the image conveys a sense of vibrancy and energy, characteristic of urban life in Beijing."}
