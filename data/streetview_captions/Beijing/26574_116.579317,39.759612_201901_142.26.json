Numerous cars, painted in shades of white, black, and gray, are scattered across the road, while a few buses add to the diversity of vehicles. The street is lined with trees, their leaves a vibrant green, providing a stark contrast to the concrete jungle. \n\nPower lines crisscross above, forming an intricate web that mirrors the complexity of the city's infrastructure.
