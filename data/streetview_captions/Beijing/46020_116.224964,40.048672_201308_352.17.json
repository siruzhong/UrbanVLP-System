The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves forming a natural canopy overhead. A white car is parked on the side of the road, adding a touch of modernity to the otherwise tranquil setting. In the distance, a red brick building stands, its vibrant color contrasting with the greenery around it. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it, completing the picturesque view of this worldwide landmark."}
