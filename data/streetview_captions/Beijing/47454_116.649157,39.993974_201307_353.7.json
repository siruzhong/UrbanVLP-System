The street, lined with lush green trees and bushes, extends into the distance, creating a sense of depth and perspective. A white van is parked on the right side of the street, adding a touch of urban life to the otherwise tranquil scene. On the left side of the street, a solitary street lamp stands tall, ready to illuminate the area as dusk falls. The image is taken from a low angle, which gives a unique perspective, making the viewer feel as if they are standing right there on the street, looking up at the sky. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the green of the trees and bushes contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky. The image does not provide any specific details that could be used to identify the exact location of this streetview."}
