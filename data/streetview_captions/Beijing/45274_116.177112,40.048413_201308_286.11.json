The perspective is from the middle of the street, looking towards the horizon. The street is flanked by lush green trees on both sides, creating a natural canopy overhead. Power lines stretch across the scene, following the curve of the street. A few cars are parked on the side of the road, adding a touch of urban life to the otherwise serene setting. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it. The image is captured from a low angle, which gives a sense of depth and scale to the scene. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the green of the trees contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky. The image does not contain any text or require counting of objects. The relative positions of the objects suggest a well-planned urban layout, with the trees, power lines, and cars all neatly aligned along the street. The image does not contain any imaginary content; everything described can be confidently determined from the image itself. The image does not contain any aesthetic descriptions."}
