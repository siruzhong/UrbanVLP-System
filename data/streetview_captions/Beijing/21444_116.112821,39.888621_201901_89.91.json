The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is flanked by towering buildings and skyscrapers, their glass facades reflecting the clear blue sky. The buildings are predominantly white and gray, punctuated by occasional red and green accents, adding a touch of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. The street itself is lined with lush green trees and shrubs, providing a stark contrast to the urban landscape. Overhead, power lines crisscross against the backdrop of the sky, a common sight in many cityscapes. The image is bathed in the warm glow of the sun, casting long shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings."}
