The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The sky is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly in the center of the image, casting a warm glow over the scene. The street itself is lined with trees and buildings, their details softened by the distance. In the distance, power lines stretch across the sky, adding a touch of urbanity to the otherwise natural landscape."}
