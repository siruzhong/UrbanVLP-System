The street, bathed in the warm glow of the sun, stretches out into the distance, flanked by lush greenery on both sides. A lamppost stands tall on the left side of the street, its presence adding a touch of urbanity to the otherwise natural landscape. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting long shadows and illuminating the scene with a golden light. The perspective of the image is from ground level, looking down the street, giving a sense of depth and inviting the viewer to imagine walking down this picturesque street."}
