The perspective is from the sidewalk, looking down the length of the street. The street is lined with trees and buildings, creating a corridor of urban life. Cars are parked along the side of the road, hinting at the hustle and bustle of city dwellers going about their day. Power lines crisscross above, a common sight in many urban areas. The sky above is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the scene."}
