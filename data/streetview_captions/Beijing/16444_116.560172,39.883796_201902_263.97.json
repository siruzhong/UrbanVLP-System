The street, bathed in the warm glow of the sun, stretches out into the distance, flanked by trees on both sides. The trees, standing tall and proud, add a touch of green to the otherwise urban landscape. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting long shadows on the ground. The perspective of the image is from the middle of the street, looking down its length, giving a sense of depth and distance. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the green of the trees contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky."}
