The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene and creating a lens flare in the top left corner of the image. The buildings in the background, painted in shades of white and gray, add a touch of urbanity to the otherwise natural landscape. The image beautifully encapsulates the blend of nature and architecture that characterizes Beijing."}
