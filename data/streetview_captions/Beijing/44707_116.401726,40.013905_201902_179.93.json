The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, providing a stark contrast to the clear blue sky. Power lines crisscross above, adding an urban touch to the otherwise natural landscape. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades bathed in the soft light of the day. A bus is visible on the right side of the road, hinting at the hustle and bustle of city life. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the green of the trees and the blue of the sky standing out against the more muted tones of the buildings."}
