The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees and bushes, adding a touch of nature to the urban landscape. A concrete overpass arches over the street, its white railing standing out against the gray of the concrete. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it. The image is captured using a fisheye lens, which distorts the edges of the frame, adding a unique perspective to the scene. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the green of the trees and bushes contrasting with the blue of the sky and the gray of the overpass. The image does not provide any specific details that could be used to identify the exact location of this street in Beijing."}
