The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the surroundings. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves rustling in the unseen breeze, casting dappled shadows on the cobblestone pavement. A few cars are parked along the side of the road, their metallic bodies gleaming under the sunlight. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The image is a beautiful representation of urban life in Beijing, where nature and cityscape coexist harmoniously."}
