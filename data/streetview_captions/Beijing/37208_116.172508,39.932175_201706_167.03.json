The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly made of brick and concrete, their facades adorned with signs and advertisements that add a splash of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. Overhead, power lines crisscross against the backdrop of a clear blue sky, punctuated by a smattering of clouds. The street itself is a hive of activity, with people and vehicles going about their day, adding a dynamic element to the scene."}
