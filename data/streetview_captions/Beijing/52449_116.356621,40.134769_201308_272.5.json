The street, bathed in the warm glow of the sun, is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. The sky above is a clear blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds. A black car is parked on the right side of the street, its sleek form contrasting with the rustic charm of the surroundings. On the left side of the street, a white building stands tall, its facade adorned with a green awning that adds a splash of color to the scene. The perspective of the image is from the middle of the street, looking towards the building, giving a sense of depth and dimension to the scene. The image captures the essence of a sunny day in Beijing, where nature and urban life coexist harmoniously."}
