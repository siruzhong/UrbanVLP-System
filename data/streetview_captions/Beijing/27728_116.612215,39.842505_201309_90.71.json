The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees on both sides, their leaves forming a natural canopy overhead. A brick building stands on the right side of the street, its red-brown hues contrasting with the greenery. On the left side of the street, a white bridge arches gracefully, connecting the two sides of the street. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it. The image is captured in a 360-degree format, providing a comprehensive view of the street and its surroundings."}
