The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves forming a natural canopy overhead. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades bathed in the warm glow of the setting sun. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun setting on the right side of the frame, casting long shadows and bathing the scene in a soft, golden light."}
