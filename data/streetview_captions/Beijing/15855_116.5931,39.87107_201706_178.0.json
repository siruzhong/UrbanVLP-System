The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of depth and scale to the scene. The trees, filled with lush green leaves, stand tall on both sides of the street, their branches reaching out towards the overcast sky. The street itself is devoid of any vehicles or pedestrians, adding to the tranquility of the scene. In the distance, a few buildings can be seen, their details softened by the distance. The colors in the image are predominantly green and gray, reflecting the natural and urban elements of the scene."}
