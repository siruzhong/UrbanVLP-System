The perspective is from a car on the road, giving a driver's eye view of the city's daily life. The highway is teeming with cars and trucks, their colors muted under the bright sunlight. Buildings rise in the distance, their details softened by the distance. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun casting a bright light that illuminates the scene. The image is taken from a low angle, adding a sense of depth and perspective to the view."}
