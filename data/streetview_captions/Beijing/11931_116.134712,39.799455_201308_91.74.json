The perspective is from the sidewalk, looking down the length of the street. The street itself is divided into two lanes by a white line, with a third lane visible on the right side. A few cars can be seen driving down the street, and a bus is parked on the right side of the road.\n\nOn either side of the street, there are trees and bushes, adding a touch of greenery to the urban landscape. On the left side of the street, there's a building with a red roof, while on the right side, a white building with a blue roof stands out.
