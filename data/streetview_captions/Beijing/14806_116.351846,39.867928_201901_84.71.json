The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is flanked by trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the blue sky. A white van is parked on the left side of the street, adding a touch of urban life to the otherwise serene setting. On the right side of the street, a building stands tall, its facade adorned with red and white banners that add a splash of color to the scene. In the distance, a body of water can be seen, reflecting the sky and adding a sense of tranquility to the bustling cityscape. The image beautifully encapsulates the blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
