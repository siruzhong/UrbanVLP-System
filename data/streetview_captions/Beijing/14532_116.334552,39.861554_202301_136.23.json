The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves forming a natural canopy overhead. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city. The sky above is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the scene. The colors in the image are muted, with the green of the trees contrasting with the gray of the buildings and the sky."}
