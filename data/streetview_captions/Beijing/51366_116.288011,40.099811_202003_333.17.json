The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves forming a canopy that filters the sunlight, casting dappled shadows on the road below. A bridge arches over the street, connecting two parts of the city. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, illuminating the scene with a warm, inviting glow. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the green of the trees contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky. The image does not provide enough information to confidently identify the specific landmark."}
