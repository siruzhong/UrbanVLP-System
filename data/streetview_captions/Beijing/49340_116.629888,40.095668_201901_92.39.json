The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves forming a canopy that filters the sunlight. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it. Cars are driving on the road, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static scene. The colors in the image are predominantly green and blue, with the green of the trees contrasting with the blue of the sky."}
