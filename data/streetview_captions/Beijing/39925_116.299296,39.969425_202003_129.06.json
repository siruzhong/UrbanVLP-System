The perspective is from a car on the road, giving a sense of being in the midst of the city's hustle and bustle. The street is flanked by towering buildings, their facades a mix of modern and traditional architecture, reflecting the city's rich history and its march towards the future. The sky above is a hazy gray, casting a soft light over the scene. In the distance, a bridge stretches across the street, connecting two parts of the city. The image is taken from a low angle, which emphasizes the height of the buildings and gives a sense of scale to the scene."}
