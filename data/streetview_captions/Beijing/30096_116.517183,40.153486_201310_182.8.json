The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves rustling in the breeze, casting dappled shadows on the gray asphalt. A black car is parked on the right side of the street, adding a touch of modernity to the otherwise serene setting. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The image beautifully encapsulates the blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
