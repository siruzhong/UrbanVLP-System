The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves forming a canopy over the road. Power lines crisscross above, adding a touch of urbanity to the otherwise natural landscape. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city. People can be seen walking on the sidewalk, going about their day, adding a human element to the scene. The colors in the image are predominantly green and gray, with the green of the trees contrasting with the gray of the buildings and the road."}
