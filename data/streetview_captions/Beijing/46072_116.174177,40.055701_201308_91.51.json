The perspective is from the middle of the street, looking towards the horizon. The street is flanked by trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it. On the right side of the street, there's a building with a red roof, standing out against the greenery. A car is parked on the left side of the street, adding a touch of modernity to the scene. The image does not contain any discernible text. The relative positions of the objects suggest a quiet, possibly early morning or late afternoon, moment in this part of Beijing. The image does not provide enough detail to confidently count the number of trees or other objects. The colors in the image are predominantly green from the trees, blue from the sky, and red from the building roof."}
