The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly white and gray, punctuated by occasional blue and green accents, reflecting the urban architectural style of the city. The street itself is a hive of activity, filled with cars and buses navigating their way through the city's arteries. Pedestrians can be seen as well, adding a human element to the urban landscape. The sky overhead is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the scene."}
