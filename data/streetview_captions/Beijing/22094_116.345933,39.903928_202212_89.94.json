The vantage point is high, providing a bird's eye view of the urban landscape below. The street, lined with trees and buildings, stretches out into the distance, creating a sense of depth and scale. The buildings, predominantly white and beige, are punctuated by occasional splashes of red and blue, adding a vibrant contrast to the otherwise monochromatic palette.
