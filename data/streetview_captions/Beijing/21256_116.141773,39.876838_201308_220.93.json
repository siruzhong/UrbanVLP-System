The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves forming a canopy that filters the sunlight, casting dappled shadows on the road below. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, illuminating the scene with a warm, inviting glow. In the distance, buildings rise, their details softened by the distance and the foliage. The colors in the image are predominantly green and blue, with the green of the trees contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky."}
