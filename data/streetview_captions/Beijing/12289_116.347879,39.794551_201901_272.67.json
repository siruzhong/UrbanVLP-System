The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with bare trees, their branches reaching out towards the clear blue sky. A blue fence runs along the right side of the street, adding a pop of color to the otherwise muted tones of the scene. In the distance, buildings rise, their silhouettes faint against the bright sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene."}
