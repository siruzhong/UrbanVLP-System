The bridge's white color contrasts beautifully with the clear blue sky above. In the distance, power lines crisscross the sky, adding a touch of urbanity to the scene. The street itself is lined with lush green trees and bushes, providing a refreshing burst of nature amidst the cityscape. A few cars can be seen driving on the road, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static scene.
