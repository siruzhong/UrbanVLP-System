The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves forming a canopy that filters the sunlight, casting dappled shadows on the pavement below. Parked cars, mostly in shades of white and black, are neatly lined up along the sides of the street, adding a touch of urbanity to the otherwise natural setting. In the distance, red brick buildings rise, their traditional architecture a stark contrast to the modern cars. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, illuminating the scene with a warm glow."}
