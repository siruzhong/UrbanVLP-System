The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with modern buildings, their glass and steel facades reflecting the overcast sky. The trees lining the street are bare, suggesting it might be late autumn or winter. The colors in the image are predominantly gray and green, with the gray of the buildings and the overcast sky contrasting with the green of the trees. The street itself is devoid of people and vehicles, adding a sense of tranquility to the scene."}
