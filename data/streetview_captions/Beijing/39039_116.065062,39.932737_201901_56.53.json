The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with buildings on both sides, their facades bathed in the soft light of the day. Trees and street lamps punctuate the scene, adding elements of nature and urban design. In the distance, mountains rise against the sky, their majestic peaks visible even from this vantage point. The colors in the image are predominantly blue, green, and gray, reflecting the natural and man-made elements of the scene. The overall effect is a harmonious blend of urban and natural landscapes, a characteristic feature of Beijing's cityscape."}
