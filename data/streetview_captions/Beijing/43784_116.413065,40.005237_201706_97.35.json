The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. Power lines crisscross above, adding a touch of urbanity to the otherwise natural landscape. Buildings rise in the distance, their architecture hinting at the city's blend of tradition and modernity. The image is bathed in the warm glow of a sunny day, casting long shadows and highlighting the textures of the trees and buildings."}
