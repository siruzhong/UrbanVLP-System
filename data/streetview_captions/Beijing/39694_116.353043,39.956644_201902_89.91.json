The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly white and gray, with occasional red and green accents adding a touch of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. \n\nThe street itself is lined with trees, their leaves forming a natural canopy over the urban landscape. Cars and taxis are scattered along the road, hinting at the hustle and bustle of city life. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings."}
