The perspective is from the middle of the street, looking down its length towards the horizon. The street is flanked by trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it. On the right side of the street, there are lampposts standing tall, their presence adding a touch of urbanity to the otherwise natural landscape. The image is taken from a low angle, which gives a sense of depth and perspective, drawing the viewer's eye down the street towards the horizon. The colors in the image are rich and natural, with the green of the trees contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky. The overall effect is a harmonious blend of urban and natural elements, a characteristic feature of Beijing's cityscape."}
