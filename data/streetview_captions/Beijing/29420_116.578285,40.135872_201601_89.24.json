The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with buildings and trees, creating a harmonious blend of urban and natural elements. The buildings, painted in shades of white and gray, stand tall against the backdrop of a clear blue sky. The trees, with their lush green foliage, add a touch of nature to the urban landscape. Overhead, power lines crisscross the sky, a common sight in many cities. The image is bathed in the warm glow of the sun, casting long shadows and highlighting the textures of the buildings and trees."}
