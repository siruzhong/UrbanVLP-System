The perspective is from a car on the road, giving a driver's eye view of the scene. The highway, divided by a concrete barrier, stretches out ahead, filled with cars moving in both directions. The sky above is a clear blue, providing a stark contrast to the urban landscape below. In the distance, mountains rise, adding a touch of nature to the cityscape. The sun shines brightly, illuminating the scene and casting shadows that add depth to the image."}
