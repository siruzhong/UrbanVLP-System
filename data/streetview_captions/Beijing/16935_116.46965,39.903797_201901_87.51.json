The perspective is from a high vantage point, providing a bird's eye view of the cityscape. The street, filled with cars and buses, cuts through the heart of the city, flanked by towering buildings on both sides. These structures, predominantly white and gray, rise high into the overcast sky, their monotone palette punctuated by occasional splashes of red and green. The street itself is lined with trees and lampposts, adding a touch of greenery to the urban landscape. Despite the overcast sky, the city exudes a sense of vibrancy and activity."}
