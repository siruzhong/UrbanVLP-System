Trees and bushes line the sides of the street, providing a touch of greenery amidst the urban landscape. The sky above is a clear blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds, casting a bright light that illuminates the scene. \n\nThe image is a snapshot of urban life in Beijing, capturing the movement and energy of the city in a single frame. It's a blend of architecture, transportation, and nature, all under the vast expanse of the sky."}
