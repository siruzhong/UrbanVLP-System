The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with buildings and trees, creating a harmonious blend of urban and natural elements. The buildings, painted in shades of white and gray, rise majestically against the backdrop of a hazy blue sky. The trees, mostly bare, add a touch of starkness to the scene, hinting at the chill in the air. A few people can be seen walking on the sidewalk, adding a touch of life to the otherwise still image. The colors in the image are predominantly gray, green, and blue, reflecting the typical weather conditions in Beijing during this time of the year."}
