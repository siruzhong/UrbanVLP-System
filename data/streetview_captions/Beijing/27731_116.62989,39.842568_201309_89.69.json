The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, which is a clear blue with a few scattered clouds. The trees, tall and lush with green leaves, line both sides of the street, creating a natural canopy overhead. The street itself is paved with gray asphalt, providing a stark contrast to the vibrant greenery. On the right side of the street, there's a building with a blue roof, adding a splash of color to the scene. The overall image gives a sense of tranquility and harmony with nature."}
