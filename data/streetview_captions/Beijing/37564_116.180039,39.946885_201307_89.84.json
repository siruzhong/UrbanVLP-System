The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves forming a canopy overhead. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city. Power lines crisscross above, connecting the buildings and adding a touch of urbanity to the scene. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting shadows that add depth and contrast to the image."}
