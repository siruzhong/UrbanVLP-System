The perspective is from a car on the road, giving a sense of being in the midst of the action.

Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the road, their facades a testament to the architectural diversity of the city. Cars of different makes and models are seen driving along the road, their colors muted under the bright sunlight.\n\nThe image is taken from a low angle, which emphasizes the height of the buildings and the expanse of the sky.
