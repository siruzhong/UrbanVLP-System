The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the surroundings. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. A black car is parked on the right side of the street, adding a touch of modernity to the otherwise tranquil setting. On the left side of the street, a blue fence stands out against the greenery, perhaps marking the boundary of a property. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it, suggesting a bright and sunny day. The image beautifully encapsulates the blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
