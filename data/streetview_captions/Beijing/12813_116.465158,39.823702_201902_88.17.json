The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with buildings and trees, creating a harmonious blend of urban and natural elements. The buildings, painted in shades of white and gray, rise majestically against the backdrop of a clear blue sky. The trees, adorned with vibrant red lanterns, add a splash of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow on the scene and highlighting the textures of the buildings and trees."}
