The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees and buildings, creating a harmonious blend of nature and architecture. A bus is captured in motion, driving down the street, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise tranquil setting. The sky above is a clear blue, and the sun is shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The image is slightly distorted due to the fisheye lens effect, adding a unique perspective to the photograph."}
