The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the surroundings. The street is flanked by trees on both sides, their leaves forming a natural canopy overhead. A concrete overpass arches over the street, adding an urban touch to the otherwise natural landscape. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene."}
