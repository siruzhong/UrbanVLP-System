The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the surroundings. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. A white van is parked on the side of the road, adding a touch of modern life to the otherwise tranquil setting. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The image beautifully encapsulates the blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
