The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, providing a vibrant contrast to the clear blue sky. On either side of the street, modern buildings rise, their glass facades reflecting the sunlight and adding a touch of urban sophistication to the scene. The overall color palette is dominated by shades of green from the trees and blue from the sky, punctuated by the metallic sheen of the buildings. The image does not contain any discernible text or specific actions being performed by objects. The relative positions of the objects suggest a well-planned urban layout, with buildings and trees neatly aligned along the street. The image does not provide enough detail to confidently count the number of objects or identify specific types of objects beyond those described. The image is a testament to the harmonious coexistence of nature and urban development in Beijing."}
