The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees and bushes, adding a touch of nature to the urban landscape. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city. Overhead, power lines crisscross the sky, a common sight in many urban areas. The sky itself is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the scene."}
