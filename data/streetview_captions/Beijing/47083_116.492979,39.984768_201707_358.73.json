The street, lined with trees and buildings, extends into the distance, creating a sense of depth and perspective. A metal bridge arches over the street, adding an industrial touch to the scene. The sky above is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the entire scene. The predominant colors in the image are green from the trees and brown from the buildings and bridge, with hints of gray from the overcast sky. The image is taken from a low angle, which emphasizes the length of the street and the height of the buildings."}
