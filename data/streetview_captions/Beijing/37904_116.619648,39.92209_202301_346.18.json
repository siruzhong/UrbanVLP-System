The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with bare trees, their branches reaching out into the clear blue sky. On the right side of the street, there's a construction site, marked by a large crane and scaffolding, indicating ongoing development in the area. The buildings on the left side of the street are adorned with white walls and gray roofs, typical of traditional Chinese architecture. The sunlight illuminates the scene, casting shadows and highlighting the details of the buildings and the construction site."}
