The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with buildings on both sides, their facades bathed in the warm glow of the sun. Power lines crisscross above, adding a touch of urbanity to the scene. In the distance, a highway overpass stretches across the frame, a testament to the city's bustling infrastructure. The sky above is a clear blue, providing a striking contrast to the earthy tones of the buildings."}
