The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves rustling in the unseen breeze, casting dappled shadows on the road below. A few cars are parked along the side of the road, their metallic bodies gleaming under the soft sunlight. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it, adding to the overall tranquility of the scene."}
