The buildings, tall and modern, rise on either side of the street, their glass facades reflecting the sunlight. The street itself is a hive of activity, with cars and buses moving along it, their colors muted against the stark white of the road. The perspective of the image is from a high vantage point, looking down on the scene, giving a sense of scale and depth to the cityscape. The sky above is a clear blue, devoid of clouds, adding to the overall brightness of the scene."}
