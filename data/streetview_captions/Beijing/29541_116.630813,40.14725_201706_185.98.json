The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their lush greenery contrasting beautifully with the clear blue sky above. The trees are evenly spaced, creating a rhythmic pattern that draws the eye along the length of the street.
