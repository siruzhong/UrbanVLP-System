The perspective is from a high vantage point, providing a bird's eye view of the scene below. The street, divided by a median, stretches out into the distance, flanked by buildings and trees on either side. Power lines crisscross above, forming a network of lines against the sky. The sky itself is a clear blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene."}
