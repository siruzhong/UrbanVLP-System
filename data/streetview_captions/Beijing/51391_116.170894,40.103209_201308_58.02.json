The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The sky is a clear blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds. The street itself is lined with lush green trees and bushes, adding a touch of nature to the urban setting. Street lamps stand sentinel along the sides of the road, ready to bathe the scene in a warm glow as dusk falls. Power lines crisscross overhead, a testament to the city's infrastructure.
