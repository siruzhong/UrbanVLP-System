The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The sky is a clear blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene.\n\nThe street itself is lined with lush green trees, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. Power lines stretch across the sky, connecting the buildings on either side of the street. These buildings, painted in shades of white and gray, add a touch of urbanity to the otherwise natural landscape.\n\nOn the right side of the street, there's a fence running parallel to it. Beyond the fence, you can see a serene body of water, its surface shimmering under the sunlight. In the distance, majestic mountains rise against the horizon, their peaks touching the sky.\n\nOverall, the image captures a beautiful day in Beijing, where nature and urban life coexist harmoniously."}
