The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street itself is lined with lush green trees and shrubs, adding a touch of nature to the urban landscape. A large concrete overpass arches over the street, its curved design adding an architectural interest to the scene. The sky above is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the entire scene."}
