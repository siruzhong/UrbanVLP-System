The perspective is from the middle of the street, looking towards the horizon. The street is lined with trees on both sides, providing a green canopy over the road. A red car is parked on the right side of the street, adding a pop of color to the scene. On the left side of the street, there's a building with a blue roof, while on the right side, a white building with a gray roof stands. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it. The image does not contain any discernible text. The relative positions of the objects suggest a quiet, possibly early morning or late afternoon, moment on this street in Beijing."}
