The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees on both sides, their leaves forming a natural canopy overhead. The sun shines brightly in the clear blue sky, casting a warm glow on the scene. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the green of the trees contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky. The image does not contain any text or discernible actions. The relative positions of the objects suggest a well-planned urban layout, with the trees and buildings neatly aligned along the street. The image does not provide enough detail to confidently count the number of objects or identify specific types of objects. The image is a testament to the harmonious coexistence of nature and urban development in Beijing."}
