The perspective is from a car on the road, giving a driver's eye view of the cityscape. The street, divided by a median, stretches out ahead, flanked by buildings and trees on both sides. The sky above is a clear blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds. In the distance, majestic mountains rise against the horizon, adding a touch of nature's grandeur to the urban landscape."}
