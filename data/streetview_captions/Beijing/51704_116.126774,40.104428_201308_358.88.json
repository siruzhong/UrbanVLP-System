The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the surroundings. The street is flanked by lush green trees and shrubs, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it, adding depth to the vast expanse. On the right side of the street, a red car is parked, its vibrant color contrasting with the natural hues around it. The image is bathed in the soft light of day, casting long shadows and highlighting the textures of the foliage."}
