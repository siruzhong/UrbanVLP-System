The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves rustling in the unseen breeze, and towering buildings that reach up towards the clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow on the scene and creating a lens flare in the top right corner of the image. The image is slightly distorted due to the fisheye effect, adding a unique perspective to the urban landscape."}
