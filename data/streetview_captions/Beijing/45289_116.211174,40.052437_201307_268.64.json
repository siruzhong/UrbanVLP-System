The perspective is from the middle of the street, looking towards the horizon. The street is flanked by lush green trees and bushes on both sides, creating a natural canopy overhead. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly in the distance, casting a warm glow over the scene. The road itself is lined with streetlights, standing like sentinels along the way. The image does not contain any discernible text or countable objects. The relative positions of the objects suggest a well-planned urban landscape, with the road serving as a dividing line between the greenery and the sky. The image does not depict any specific actions or movements. The colors in the image are predominantly green from the vegetation, blue from the sky, and gray from the road and streetlights. The sun's position in the background suggests it's either early morning or late afternoon. The image does not contain any aesthetic descriptions."}
