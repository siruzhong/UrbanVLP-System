The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the surroundings. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. A white car is parked on the side of the road, adding a touch of modernity to the otherwise tranquil setting. In the distance, a red building stands out against the greenery, its vibrant color contrasting beautifully with the surrounding foliage. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it, casting soft shadows on the ground below. The image is a beautiful blend of nature and urban life, showcasing the harmonious coexistence of the two in Beijing."}
