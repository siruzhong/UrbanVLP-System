The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with bare trees, their leafless branches reaching towards the clear blue sky. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades bathed in sunlight. On the right side of the street, stacks of bricks are neatly arranged, hinting at ongoing construction or renovation work. The image is slightly distorted due to the fisheye lens effect, adding a unique perspective to the urban landscape."}
