The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades bathed in sunlight. Overhead, power lines crisscross the sky, adding a touch of urbanity to the scene. In the distance, a yellow crane stands tall, hinting at ongoing construction or development in the area."}
