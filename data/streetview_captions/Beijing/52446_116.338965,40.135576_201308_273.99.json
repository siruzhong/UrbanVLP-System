The street is flanked by lush green trees on both sides, creating a natural canopy overhead. A white building with a red roof stands prominently on the right side of the street, its vibrant colors contrasting beautifully with the surrounding greenery. On the left side of the street, a black car is parked, adding a touch of modernity to the otherwise serene setting. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The image is captured from a low angle, giving a unique perspective that emphasizes the height of the trees and the building. The overall composition of the image suggests a peaceful and idyllic urban landscape."}
