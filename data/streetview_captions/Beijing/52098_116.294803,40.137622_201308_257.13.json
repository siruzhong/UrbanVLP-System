The street is flanked by lush green trees on both sides, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. A tranquil lake graces the right side of the street, its calm waters reflecting the clear blue sky above. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The perspective of the image is from a low angle, looking up towards the towering trees and the expansive sky, creating a sense of depth and scale. The colors in the image are vibrant and natural, with the green of the trees contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky. The image does not contain any text or discernible actions. The relative positions of the objects suggest a well-planned urban landscape, with the lake providing a natural counterpoint to the man-made structures. The image is a testament to the harmonious coexistence of nature and urban development in Beijing."}
