The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with modern buildings, their facades made of glass and steel, reflecting the sunlight and adding a metallic sheen to the scene. The buildings are interspersed with trees, their green leaves contrasting with the urban landscape. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it, adding depth to the background. The image is bathed in the warm glow of the setting sun, casting long shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings."}
