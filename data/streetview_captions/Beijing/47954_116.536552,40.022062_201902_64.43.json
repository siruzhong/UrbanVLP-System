The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their bare branches reaching out into the clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow on the scene. In the distance, a building with a distinctive curved roof can be seen, adding a unique architectural element to the landscape. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the green of the trees contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky."}
