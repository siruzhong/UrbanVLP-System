Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city. Among these structures, a large white building with a distinctive curved roof stands out, its modern design contrasting with the traditional architecture of the surrounding buildings.\n\nThe image does not contain any discernible text or specific actions being performed by objects. The relative positions of the objects suggest a well-planned urban layout, with buildings and greenery neatly arranged along the street. The image does not provide enough detail to confidently count the number of objects or describe their precise locations. However, the overall composition of the image paints a vivid picture of a day in the life of a vibrant city like Beijing."}
