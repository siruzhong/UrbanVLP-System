The perspective is from a high angle, providing a bird's eye view of the street that stretches out into the distance. The trees, stripped of their leaves, stand tall and bare, their branches reaching out towards the overcast sky. The ground is blanketed in a layer of snow, adding a serene and peaceful atmosphere to the scene. The colors in the image are predominantly gray and brown, reflecting the cold winter season."}
