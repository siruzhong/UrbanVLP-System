The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, providing a vibrant contrast to the urban landscape. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city. A yellow truck and a white van are seen driving down the road, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static scene. The sky above is a clear blue, with wispy clouds scattered across it, casting soft shadows on the street below."}
