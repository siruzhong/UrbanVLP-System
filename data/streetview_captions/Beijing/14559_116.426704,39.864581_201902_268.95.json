The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly white and gray, punctuated by occasional splashes of red and green. The street itself is a hive of activity, with cars and buses moving along its length, adding a dynamic element to the scene. On either side of the street, blue scaffolding stands out against the urban backdrop, hinting at ongoing construction or renovation work. The sky above is a clear blue, providing a serene contrast to the busy street scene below."}
