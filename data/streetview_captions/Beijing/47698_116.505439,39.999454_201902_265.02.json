The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees and buildings, their colors muted under the clear blue sky. Power lines crisscross above, forming a complex web against the backdrop of the sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene. The image is slightly distorted due to the fisheye lens effect, adding a unique perspective to the urban landscape."}
