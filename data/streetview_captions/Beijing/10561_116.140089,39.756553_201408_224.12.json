The perspective is from a high vantage point, providing a bird's eye view of the scene below. The street, divided by a median, is lined with lush green trees and shrubs, adding a touch of nature to the urban landscape. \n\nVehicles, including cars and buses, traverse the road, their colors muted against the vibrant backdrop of the city. The sky above is a clear blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene."}
