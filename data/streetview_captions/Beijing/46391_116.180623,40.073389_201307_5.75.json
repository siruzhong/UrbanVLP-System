The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the surroundings. The sky is a clear blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds, and the sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The street itself is lined with lush green trees and bushes, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. On the right side of the street, there's a sidewalk where a few people can be seen walking, adding a touch of life to the otherwise tranquil setting. The image beautifully encapsulates the blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
