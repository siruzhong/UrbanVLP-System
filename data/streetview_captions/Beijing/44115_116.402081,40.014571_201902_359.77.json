The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees and buildings, their details softened by the distance. A white car is parked on the right side of the street, adding a touch of modernity to the scene. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun setting in the background, casting a warm glow over the entire scene."}
