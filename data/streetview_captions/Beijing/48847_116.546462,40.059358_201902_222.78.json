Parked cars line the side of the road, adding to the urban feel of the scene. Trees dot the landscape, providing pockets of greenery amidst the concrete structures.\n\nThe sun is shining brightly in the top right corner of the image, casting a warm glow over the scene and creating a lens flare that adds a touch of whimsy to the otherwise realistic image.
