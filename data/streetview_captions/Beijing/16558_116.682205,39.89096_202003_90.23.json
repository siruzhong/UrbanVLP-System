The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings and the clear blue sky. The buildings, painted in shades of white and gray, rise majestically, their facades adorned with vibrant advertisements and billboards. The street below is a hive of activity, with cars and buses navigating their way through the urban landscape. The sun shines brightly overhead, casting a warm glow on the scene."}
