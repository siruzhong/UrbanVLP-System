The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. In the distance, buildings rise, their details softened by the perspective. The image is bathed in natural light, highlighting the colors and creating a lively atmosphere."}
