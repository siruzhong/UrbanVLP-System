The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly white and red brick, punctuated by large windows that reflect the clear blue sky. The street itself is a hive of activity, with cars and pedestrians adding life to the urban landscape. On the right side of the street, trees provide a touch of greenery, their leaves rustling in the unseen breeze. The sun shines brightly overhead, casting long shadows and bathing the scene in a warm, inviting light."}
