The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees and bushes, adding a touch of nature to the urban landscape. A brick wall runs along the right side of the street, providing a contrast to the natural elements. In the distance, power lines stretch across the sky, a common sight in many cities. The sky above is a clear blue, dotted with a few clouds, suggesting a bright and sunny day."}
