The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with buildings on both sides, their white facades standing out against the blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings. In the distance, trees can be seen, adding a touch of nature to the urban landscape. The image does not provide enough information to confidently identify the specific landmark."}
