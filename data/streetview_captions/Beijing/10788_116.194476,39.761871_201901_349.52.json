A car is parked on the street, adding a touch of everyday life to the scene. On the left side of the street, a street lamp stands tall, ready to illuminate the area as dusk falls. \n\nThe image is a blend of urban architecture and natural elements, showcasing the harmonious coexistence of man-made structures and nature in Beijing."}
