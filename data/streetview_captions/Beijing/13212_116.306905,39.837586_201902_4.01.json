The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with buildings on both sides, their white facades standing out against the blue sky. The buildings are adorned with red lanterns, adding a splash of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. Trees and bushes are scattered throughout the scene, providing a touch of greenery. The street itself is devoid of any traffic or pedestrians, giving it a serene and quiet atmosphere."}
