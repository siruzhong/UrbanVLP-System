The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The sky is a clear blue, with a few wispy clouds scattered across it. The street itself is lined with lush green trees, providing a vibrant contrast to the urban landscape. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades bathed in the soft light of the day. Streetlights stand sentinel along the road, their presence hinting at the transformation of the scene as day gives way to night. The image is bathed in the warm glow of daylight, with the sun casting long shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings."}
