The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the surroundings. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. A blue fence runs along the right side of the street, adding a pop of color to the scene. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. In the distance, tall buildings rise, their silhouettes forming a contrasting backdrop to the natural elements in the foreground. The image beautifully encapsulates the blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
