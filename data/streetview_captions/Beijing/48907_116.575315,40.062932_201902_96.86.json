The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with a variety of buildings, their facades painted in a palette of mostly beige and brown, punctuated by occasional splashes of red and green. Cars and pedestrians animate the scene, adding life and movement to the urban landscape. The sky above is a clear blue, providing a vibrant backdrop to the cityscape.
