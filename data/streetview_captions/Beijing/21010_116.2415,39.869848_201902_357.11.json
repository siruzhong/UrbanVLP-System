The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their branches reaching out into the sky, creating a natural canopy over the road. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city. Cars are parked along the side of the road, adding a touch of modern life to the scene. The sky above is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the entire scene. The colors in the image are muted, with shades of green from the trees, gray from the buildings and road, and hints of blue from the sky."}
