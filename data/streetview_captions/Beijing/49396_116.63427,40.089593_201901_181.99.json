The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it. The street itself is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green. Street lamps and traffic lights punctuate the scene, adding elements of urban design. In the distance, buildings rise, their silhouettes forming a cityscape against the sky. The image is bathed in the warm glow of the setting sun, casting long shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings."}
