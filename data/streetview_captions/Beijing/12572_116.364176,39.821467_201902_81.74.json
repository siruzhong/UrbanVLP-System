The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees and power lines, adding a touch of urban greenery to the cityscape. A white van is parked on the side of the road, perhaps belonging to a local resident or a delivery person. In the distance, a crane stands tall, hinting at ongoing construction or development in the area. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it, suggesting a bright and sunny day."}
