The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with buildings and trees, creating a harmonious blend of urban and natural elements. The buildings are predominantly white and gray, reflecting the architectural style often seen in Beijing. The trees, on the other hand, add a touch of green to the otherwise monochrome palette. The sky above is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the scene."}
