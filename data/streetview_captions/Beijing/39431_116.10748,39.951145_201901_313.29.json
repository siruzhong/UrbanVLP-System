The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with bare trees, their branches reaching out into the clear blue sky. The buildings on either side of the street are white, adorned with red Chinese characters that add a vibrant splash of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. The overall scene is a blend of urban architecture and natural elements, creating a harmonious balance between man-made structures and nature."}
