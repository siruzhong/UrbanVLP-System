The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of depth and scale to the scene. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The street itself is lined with lush green trees, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. Street lamps stand sentinel along the sides of the road, their presence suggesting a beautiful illumination when night falls. On the right side of the street, buildings rise up, their architecture a testament to the city's blend of tradition and modernity. The image is bathed in the soft light of day, highlighting the tranquility of this urban landscape."}
