The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly white and gray, punctuated by occasional blue and green accents that add a touch of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. The sky above is a clear blue, providing a stark contrast to the urban landscape below. The street itself is lined with trees and lampposts, adding a sense of order and symmetry to the scene. In the distance, construction cranes can be seen, hinting at the ongoing development and progress in the city."}
