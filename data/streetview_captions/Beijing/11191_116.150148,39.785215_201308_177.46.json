The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The sky is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The street is lined with lush green trees and bushes, adding a touch of nature to the urban landscape. Cars are parked neatly on the side of the road, and buildings rise in the background, their facades bathed in sunlight. The image is a beautiful representation of a sunny day in Beijing, with the city's architecture and natural elements coexisting harmoniously."}
