The perspective is from the middle of the street, looking towards the horizon. The street is lined with lush green trees on both sides, creating a natural canopy overhead. The sky above is a clear blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds. Power lines run parallel to the street, disappearing into the distance. On the right side of the street, there are buildings visible, their details slightly blurred due to the distance. The image does not contain any discernible text. The relative positions of the objects suggest a quiet, possibly early morning or late afternoon, with no people or moving vehicles in sight. The image captures the serene beauty of a typical street in Beijing, with its blend of nature and urban architecture."}
