The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves forming a natural canopy overhead. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city. The sky above is a clear blue, with a smattering of clouds adding depth to the vista. The image is bathed in the warm glow of a setting sun, casting long shadows and highlighting the textures of the buildings and trees."}
