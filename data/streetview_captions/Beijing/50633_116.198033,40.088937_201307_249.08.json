The street, bathed in the soft glow of daylight, is flanked by an array of trees and buildings. The buildings, painted in hues of white and gray, stand tall against the backdrop of a clear blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds. The trees, lush and green, add a touch of nature to the urban landscape. Overhead, power lines crisscross the sky, connecting the buildings and adding a sense of dynamism to the scene. The image is captured from a low angle, giving a unique perspective that emphasizes the height of the buildings and the expanse of the sky. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the green of the trees contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky and the gray and white of the buildings. The image does not contain any discernible text or specific actions being performed by objects. The relative positions of the objects suggest a well-planned urban layout, with buildings and trees neatly arranged along the street. The image does not provide enough detail to confidently count the number of objects or identify specific types of objects beyond those described. The image is a testament to the harmonious coexistence of nature and urban development in Beijing."}
