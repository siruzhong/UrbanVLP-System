The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees and bushes, providing a vibrant contrast to the clear blue sky. Power lines crisscross above, adding a touch of urbanity to the otherwise natural landscape. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades bathed in the warm glow of the setting sun. The sun's rays filter through the foliage, casting dappled shadows on the pavement. The image beautifully encapsulates the blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
