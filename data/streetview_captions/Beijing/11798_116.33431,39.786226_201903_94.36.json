The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is flanked by tall buildings on both sides, their gray and white facades standing out against the blue sky. The buildings are adorned with numerous windows, reflecting the sunlight and adding a touch of brightness to the otherwise monochrome palette. In the distance, a few trees can be seen, their green foliage providing a natural contrast to the urban landscape. The image is bathed in the warm glow of the sun, casting long shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings."}
