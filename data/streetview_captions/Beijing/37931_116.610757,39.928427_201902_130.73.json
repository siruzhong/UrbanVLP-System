The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of the towering buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly white and gray, punctuated by occasional orange and red accents that add a touch of vibrancy to the otherwise monochrome palette. The street itself is a hive of activity, filled with cars and pedestrians going about their day. The sky above is a clear blue, providing a stark contrast to the urban landscape below."}
