The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of the city's towering structures. The sky above is a clear blue, providing a stark contrast to the urban landscape below. The buildings, predominantly white and gray, rise high into the sky, their facades adorned with occasional splashes of red and green. The street below is a hive of activity, with cars and buses navigating their way through the city's arteries. Overhead, a network of power lines crisscrosses the sky, a testament to the city's modern infrastructure."}
