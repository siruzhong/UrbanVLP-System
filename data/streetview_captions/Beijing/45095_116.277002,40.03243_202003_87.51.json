The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with buildings on both sides, their architecture hinting at the blend of modern and traditional styles that are characteristic of Beijing. The buildings are predominantly gray and white, with occasional splashes of blue and green adding a touch of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. The sky above is hazy, casting a soft light over the scene. In the distance, power lines crisscross the sky, adding a touch of urban grit to the otherwise serene setting. The image is slightly distorted due to the fisheye lens effect, adding a unique perspective to the photograph."}
