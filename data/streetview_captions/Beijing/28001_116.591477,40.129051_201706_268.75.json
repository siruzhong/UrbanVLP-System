The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves forming a canopy over the road. On either side of the street, modern buildings rise, their glass and steel facades reflecting the light. The sky above is a hazy blue, adding a serene backdrop to the urban landscape. The colors in the image are predominantly green and gray, with hints of blue and brown, creating a harmonious palette that is pleasing to the eye."}
