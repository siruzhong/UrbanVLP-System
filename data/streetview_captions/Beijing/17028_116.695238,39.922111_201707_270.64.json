The perspective is from a high angle, providing a bird's eye view of the street that stretches out into the distance. The trees, tall and lush with green leaves, line both sides of the street, their branches forming a natural canopy overhead. The street itself is devoid of any cars or people, adding to the tranquility of the scene. On the right side of the street, there's a red building, its vibrant color contrasting with the greenery around it. The sky above is a clear blue, and the sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The image does not contain any text or specific actions being performed by objects. The relative positions of the objects remain constant, with the trees lining the street, the building on the right, and the sky above. The image does not provide any information that allows for a confident count of the objects. The colors in the image are predominantly green from the trees, blue from the sky, and red from the building."}
