The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees and power lines, adding a touch of urban greenery to the cityscape. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades adorned with colorful murals that add a vibrant splash of color to the otherwise monochrome palette of grays and browns. The sky above is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the scene."}
