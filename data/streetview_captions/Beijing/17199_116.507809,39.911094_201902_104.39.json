The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of the towering buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly white and gray, punctuated by occasional red and blue accents that add a splash of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. The street itself is a hive of activity, filled with cars and buses navigating their way through the city's arteries. Overhead, power lines crisscross against the backdrop of a clear blue sky, a common sight in many urban landscapes."}
