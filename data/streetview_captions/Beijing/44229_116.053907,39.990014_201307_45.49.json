The perspective is from the middle of the street, looking towards the horizon. The sky above is a clear blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds. On either side of the street, there are lush green trees and bushes, adding a touch of nature to the urban setting. A stone wall runs along the right side of the street, providing a contrast to the natural elements. In the distance, majestic mountains rise against the sky, their peaks shrouded in mist. The image is captured from a low angle, making the viewer feel as if they are standing right there on the street, looking up at the towering mountains and the vast sky. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the green of the trees and bushes standing out against the blue of the sky. The overall effect is a harmonious blend of urban and natural elements, a characteristic feature of Beijing's landscape."}
