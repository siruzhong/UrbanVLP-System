The street, devoid of any vehicles or pedestrians, stretches out into the distance, flanked by lush green trees on both sides. The trees, standing tall and proud, add a sense of tranquility to the scene. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it, adding depth to the vast expanse. The perspective of the image is from the center of the street, looking down its length, giving a sense of depth and distance. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the green of the trees contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky."}
