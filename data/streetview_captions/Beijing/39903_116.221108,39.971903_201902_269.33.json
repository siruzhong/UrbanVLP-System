The perspective is from a high vantage point, providing a bird's eye view of the scene. The street is flanked by trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant mix of green hues. Red lanterns hang from the trees, swaying gently in the breeze, adding a splash of color to the verdant landscape. The sky above is a clear blue, with a smattering of clouds dotting the expanse. The buildings lining the street are painted in shades of white and gray, their facades bathed in soft light. The street itself is devoid of any vehicles or pedestrians, lending an air of tranquility to the scene. The image does not contain any discernible text. The relative positions of the objects suggest a well-planned urban layout, with the buildings, trees, and lanterns all neatly aligned along the length of the street."}
