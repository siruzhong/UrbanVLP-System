The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The sky is a clear blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds. Power lines crisscross above, creating a network of lines against the sky.\n\nOn the left side of the street, there's a brick building with a red roof, adding a touch of color to the scene. On the right side, a white van is parked, perhaps waiting for its owner to return. A solitary tree stands on the right side of the street, its leaves rustling in the breeze.\n\nIn the background, there's a field of crops, hinting at the agricultural nature of the area. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the green of the crops contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky. The overall scene is a blend of urban and rural elements, typical of Beijing's diverse landscape."}
