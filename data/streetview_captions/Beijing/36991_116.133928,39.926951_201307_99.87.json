The vantage point is high, providing a bird's eye view of the street below. The street itself is lined with lush green trees, adding a touch of nature to the urban landscape. The buildings, painted in shades of white and gray, stand tall against the backdrop of a clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene. The image is taken from a low angle, making the buildings appear even taller and the sky even more expansive."}
