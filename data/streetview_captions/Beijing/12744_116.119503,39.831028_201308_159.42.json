The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees and towering buildings, creating a harmonious blend of nature and architecture. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it, adding depth to the image. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the green of the trees contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky.
