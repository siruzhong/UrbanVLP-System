The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly white and beige, punctuated by occasional blue and green accents that add a touch of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. The street itself is a hive of activity, filled with cars and pedestrians going about their day. The sky overhead is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the scene. In the distance, the tops of trees can be seen, providing a hint of nature amidst the urban landscape."}
