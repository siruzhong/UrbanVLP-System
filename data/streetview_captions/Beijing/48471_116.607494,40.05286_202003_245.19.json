The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is flanked by modern buildings with curved roofs, their white and gray facades gleaming under the clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow on the scene. The street itself is lined with trees, adding a touch of green to the urban landscape. A few cars can be seen driving on the road, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static cityscape. The image beautifully encapsulates the blend of modern architecture and natural elements that characterizes Beijing."}
