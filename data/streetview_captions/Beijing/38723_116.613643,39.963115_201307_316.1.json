The street, divided into two lanes by a white line, stretches out into the distance, flanked by lush greenery on both sides. The trees, standing tall and proud, add a touch of nature to the urban landscape. The sky above is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the scene. The perspective of the image is from the middle of the street, looking down its length, giving a sense of depth and continuity. The colors in the image are predominantly green and gray, reflecting the natural and man-made elements of the scene."}
