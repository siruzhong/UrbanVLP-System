The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with buildings on both sides, their architecture hinting at the rich history of the city. The buildings are predominantly gray and white, with occasional blue and green accents adding a touch of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting shadows that add depth to the image. In the distance, trees can be seen, their green foliage contrasting with the urban landscape."}
