The perspective is from the side of the road, giving a sense of being in the midst of the scene. The road itself is lined with trees on both sides, their green foliage contrasting with the clear blue sky above. A car is parked on the right side of the road, adding a touch of modernity to the otherwise tranquil setting. The sun shines brightly in the background, casting a warm glow over the scene. The image is taken from a low angle, which emphasizes the height of the trees and the vastness of the sky. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the green of the trees and grass standing out against the blue of the sky. The overall effect is a harmonious blend of nature and urban life."}
