The perspective is from a car on the road, giving a driver's eye view of the scene. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The highway itself is divided by a median, with trees lining both sides, adding a touch of green to the otherwise urban landscape. On the right side of the road, there are street lights standing tall, ready to illuminate the area as dusk falls. The image is taken from a low angle, making the viewer feel as if they are part of the scene, driving down the highway under the bright sun."}
