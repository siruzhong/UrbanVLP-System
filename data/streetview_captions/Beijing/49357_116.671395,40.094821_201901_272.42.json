The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is flanked by buildings on both sides, their facades bathed in the warm glow of the setting sun. Bare trees line the street, their leafless branches reaching towards the sky. The sky itself is a clear blue, with the sun setting in the background, casting long shadows and bathing the scene in a soft, golden light."}
