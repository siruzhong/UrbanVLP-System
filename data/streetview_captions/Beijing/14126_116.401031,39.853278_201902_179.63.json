The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the buildings that line the street. These buildings, made of brick, are adorned with red lanterns that hang from them, adding a splash of color to the scene. Power lines crisscross above, creating a network of lines against the blue sky. The sun shines brightly in the background, casting shadows and highlighting the details of the buildings and the street."}
