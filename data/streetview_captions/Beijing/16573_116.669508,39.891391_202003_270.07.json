The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings and the clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, adding a touch of nature to the urban landscape. The buildings, painted in shades of white and gray, rise majestically, their facades adorned with vibrant advertisements that add a splash of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. The image beautifully encapsulates the blend of nature and architecture that characterizes Beijing's cityscape."}
