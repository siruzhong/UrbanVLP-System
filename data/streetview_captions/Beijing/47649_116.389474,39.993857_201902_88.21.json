The perspective is from the center of the tunnel, looking down its length. The walls on either side curve gently, creating a sense of depth and perspective. The floor, a solid expanse of concrete, stretches out below, leading the eye towards the distant exit. A few cars can be seen in the distance, their headlights piercing the otherwise dimly lit interior. The color palette is dominated by shades of gray and white, punctuated by the warm yellow of the overhead lights. The overall effect is one of quiet solitude, a moment frozen in time within the curve of the tunnel."}
