The perspective is from a car on the road, giving a driver's eye view of the scene. The street is flanked by buildings on both sides, their facades bathed in the soft glow of the morning sun. The sky above is a hazy blue, adding a serene backdrop to the urban landscape. In the distance, a highway overpass stretches across the scene, hinting at the city's extensive transportation network. The image is taken from a low angle, which emphasizes the height of the buildings and the overpass, creating a sense of depth and scale."}
