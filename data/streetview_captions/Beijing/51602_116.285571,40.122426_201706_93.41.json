The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the image. The trees, filled with lush green leaves, line both sides of the street, creating a natural canopy overhead. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it. The street itself is paved with gray asphalt, and a car can be seen driving down it, adding a touch of urban life to the otherwise tranquil setting. The image is bathed in natural daylight, highlighting the vibrant colors and textures of the scene."}
