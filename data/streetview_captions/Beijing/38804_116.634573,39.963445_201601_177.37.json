The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the image. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their bare branches reaching out towards the clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly in the background, casting a warm glow over the scene. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the green of the trees contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky."}
