The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the image. The trees, full of lush green leaves, stand tall on both sides of the street, their branches reaching out towards the clear blue sky. The sunlight filters through the leaves, casting dappled shadows on the street below. The image is bathed in natural daylight, highlighting the vibrant colors and textures of the scene."}
