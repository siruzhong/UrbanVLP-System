The perspective is from the middle of the street, looking towards the horizon. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it. On either side of the street, there are buildings painted in shades of gray and white. These buildings are topped with red roofs, adding a pop of color to the scene. The street itself is lined with trees, their green leaves contrasting with the urban landscape. Overhead, power lines stretch across the sky, following the path of the street. The image does not contain any discernible text. The relative positions of the objects suggest a well-planned urban layout, with buildings, trees, and power lines maintaining a harmonious balance."}
