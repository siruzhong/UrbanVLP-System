The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves forming a canopy overhead. Cars are parked neatly on the side of the road, adding a touch of urban life to the otherwise serene setting. In the distance, buildings rise, their architecture hinting at the blend of traditional and modern styles that characterize Beijing. The colors in the image are predominantly green and gray, reflecting the natural and man-made elements of the scene."}
