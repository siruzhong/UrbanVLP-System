The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the image. The trees, with their lush green leaves, stand tall on either side of the street, creating a natural canopy overhead. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The street itself is paved with asphalt, and there's a sidewalk on the right side, inviting pedestrians for a leisurely stroll. On the left side of the street, there's a fence, adding to the urban feel of the scene. The image beautifully encapsulates the blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
