The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of depth and scale to the scene. The street, lined with power lines and street lamps, stretches out ahead, disappearing into the distance. Buildings flank the street on both sides, their facades bathed in the soft glow of the street lamps. The sky above is a hazy gray, adding a touch of tranquility to the urban landscape. The colors in the image are predominantly green and gray, reflecting the natural and man-made elements of the scene."}
