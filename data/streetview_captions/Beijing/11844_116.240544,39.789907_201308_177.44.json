The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The sky is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly in the top right corner, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The street itself is lined with lush green trees and shrubs, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. The road, made of asphalt, stretches out into the distance, inviting the viewer to imagine where it might lead. The image beautifully encapsulates the tranquility and beauty of a typical day in Beijing."}
