The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees on both sides, their leaves forming a canopy that filters the sunlight. The sky above is a clear blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. In the distance, a few buildings can be seen, their details softened by the distance. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the green of the trees contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky."}
