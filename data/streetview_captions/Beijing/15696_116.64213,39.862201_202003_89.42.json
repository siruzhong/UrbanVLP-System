The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The sky is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly in the top left corner, casting a warm glow over the entire scene.\n\nOn the right side of the street, there's a construction site, cordoned off by a blue fence. The fence is adorned with various advertisements, adding a splash of color and life to the otherwise industrial scene. Beyond the construction site, the cityscape of Beijing unfolds. Tall buildings stretch towards the sky, interspersed with trees that bring a touch of nature to the urban environment.\n\nThe image is a blend of urban development and natural beauty, a snapshot of a city in progress. It's a testament to the rapid growth and constant evolution of Beijing, a city where tradition and modernity coexist. The image doesn't contain any text or specific countable objects, and there are no discernible actions taking place. The relative positions of the objects are as described: the construction site on the right, the advertisements on the fence, and the buildings and trees in the background. The sun is located in the top left corner of the image. The image does not contain any imaginary content; everything described can be confidently determined from the image itself."}
