The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with bare trees, their branches reaching out into the clear blue sky. Power lines crisscross above, adding a touch of urbanity to the natural landscape. Buildings rise in the background, their details softened by the distance. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene and highlighting the textures of the trees and buildings. The colors are vibrant, with the green of the trees contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky."}
