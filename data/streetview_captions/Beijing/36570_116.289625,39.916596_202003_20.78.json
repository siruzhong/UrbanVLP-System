The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of the towering buildings that line the street. These structures, predominantly gray and white, rise high into the clear blue sky, punctuated by a few scattered clouds. The street itself is a hive of activity, with cars and buses moving along its length, adding a dynamic element to the scene. On either side of the street, trees provide a touch of greenery, their leaves a vibrant contrast to the urban landscape. The image is bathed in the bright sunlight of the day, casting sharp shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings."}
