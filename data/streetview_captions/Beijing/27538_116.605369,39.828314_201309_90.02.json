The perspective is from the middle of the street, looking down its length towards the horizon. The street is flanked on both sides by a variety of trees and shrubs, their green hues contrasting with the clear blue sky above. Power lines run parallel to the street, disappearing into the distance. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene. In the far distance, buildings can be seen, their details softened by the perspective."}
