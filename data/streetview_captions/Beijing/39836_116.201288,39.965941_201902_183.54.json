The perspective is from the middle of the street, looking towards the horizon. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green. Power lines stretch across the sky, following the curve of the street. The sky above is a clear blue, and the sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene. In the distance, mountains rise against the horizon, adding depth to the landscape. The image does not contain any text or discernible actions by objects. The relative positions of the objects suggest a well-planned urban layout, with the trees, power lines, and buildings all aligned along the street. The image does not provide enough detail to count the exact number of objects or identify specific types of objects beyond those described. The colors in the image are predominantly green from the trees, blue from the sky, and gray from the buildings and power lines. The image does not contain any imaginary content; everything described can be confidently determined from the image itself. The image does not contain any aesthetic descriptions."}
