The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of a clear blue sky. The trees are evenly spaced, creating a rhythmic pattern that draws the eye along the length of the street. In the distance, buildings can be seen, their presence subtly hinting at the urban environment surrounding this natural oasis. The colors in the image are rich and natural, with the green of the trees contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky. The overall effect is a harmonious blend of urban and natural elements, a characteristic feature of Beijing's cityscape."}
