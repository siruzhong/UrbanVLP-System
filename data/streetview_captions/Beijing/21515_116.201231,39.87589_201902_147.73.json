The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees and buildings, creating a harmonious blend of nature and architecture. The buildings are predominantly gray and white, reflecting the urban landscape of Beijing. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it, adding depth to the image. The sun is shining brightly, illuminating the scene and casting shadows that add contrast and texture to the image. The image does not contain any discernible text or specific actions being performed by objects. The relative positions of the objects suggest a well-planned urban layout, with buildings and trees neatly arranged along the street. The image does not provide enough detail to confidently count the number of objects or identify specific types of objects beyond what has been described. The image does not contain any imaginary content; everything described can be confidently determined from the image itself. The image does not contain any aesthetic descriptions."}
