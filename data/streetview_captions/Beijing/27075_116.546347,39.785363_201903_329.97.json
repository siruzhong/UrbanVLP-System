The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of the grandeur and scale of the cityscape. The street is lined with modern buildings, their facades predominantly white and gray, punctuated by occasional blue and green accents that add a touch of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. The sky above is hazy, casting a soft light over the scene. The street itself is devoid of people, adding a sense of tranquility amidst the urban setting. A few cars and buses can be seen in the distance, hinting at the city's constant movement and energy."}
