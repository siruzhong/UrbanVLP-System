The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the image. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. A red building stands prominently on the right side of the street, its vibrant color contrasting beautifully with the surrounding greenery. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The image is slightly distorted due to the fisheye lens effect, adding a unique perspective to this everyday urban landscape."}
