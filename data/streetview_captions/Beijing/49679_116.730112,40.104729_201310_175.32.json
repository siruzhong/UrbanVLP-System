The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of a clear blue sky. The trees are evenly spaced, creating a rhythmic pattern that draws the eye along the length of the street. In the distance, a few buildings can be seen, their details softened by the perspective. The image does not contain any discernible text or specific actions being performed by objects. The relative positions of the trees and buildings suggest a well-planned urban landscape. The colors in the image are predominantly green from the trees, blue from the sky, and gray from the buildings. The image does not provide enough detail to confidently count the number of trees or buildings. Overall, the image captures a serene moment on a tree-lined street in Beijing."}
