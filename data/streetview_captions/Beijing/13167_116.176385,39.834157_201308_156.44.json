The street is flanked by lush greenery on both sides, with trees and shrubs dotting the landscape. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. In the distance, power lines stretch across the sky, connecting the two sides of the street. The perspective of the image is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the scene. The image does not contain any text or discernible actions. The relative positions of the objects suggest a well-planned urban layout, with the greenery providing a natural contrast to the man-made structures. The image does not provide enough detail to confidently count the number of trees or shrubs. The colors in the image are predominantly green from the vegetation, blue from the sky, and gray from the road and power lines."}
