The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of being in the midst of the action. Buildings of various sizes and designs line the street, their facades bathed in the soft glow of the overcast sky. Construction cranes punctuate the skyline, a testament to the city's continuous growth and development. Cars and buses navigate the road, adding a dynamic element to the scene.
