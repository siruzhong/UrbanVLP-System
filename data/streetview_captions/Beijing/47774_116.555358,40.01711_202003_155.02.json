The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city. Power lines crisscross above, connecting the buildings and adding a touch of urbanity to the scene. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow on the buildings and creating a lens flare in the top right corner of the image."}
