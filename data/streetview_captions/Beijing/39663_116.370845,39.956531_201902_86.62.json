The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly white and red, punctuated by occasional blue and green accents that add a touch of color to the urban landscape. The sky above is a clear blue, providing a stark contrast to the man-made structures below. The street itself is lined with trees and lampposts, adding a sense of order and symmetry to the scene. In the distance, the tops of other buildings can be seen, hinting at the expansive cityscape beyond."}
