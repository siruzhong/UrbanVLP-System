It's adorned with a red and yellow logo, a splash of color against the monochrome backdrop. This building, with its distinctive design, seems to be a focal point in this urban landscape.\n\nIn the distance, the tops of trees can be seen, their green foliage contrasting with the concrete jungle. They serve as a reminder of nature's presence amidst the man-made structures.\n\nOverall, the image provides a comprehensive view of a day in the life of a busy street in Beijing, encapsulating the city's architectural charm and vibrant street life."}
