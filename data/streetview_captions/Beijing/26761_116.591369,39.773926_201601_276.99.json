The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene and creating a lens flare effect in the image. In the distance, tall buildings rise, their silhouettes contrasting with the natural elements in the foreground. The image appears to have been taken during the day, as indicated by the bright lighting and clear visibility of the objects."}
