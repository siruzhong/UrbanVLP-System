The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The sky is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The street itself is lined with trees and buildings, creating a harmonious blend of nature and architecture. The buildings are predominantly white and gray, reflecting the typical urban landscape of Beijing. The trees, on the other hand, add a touch of green to the otherwise monochrome palette."}
