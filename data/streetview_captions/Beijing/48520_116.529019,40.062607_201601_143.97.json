The street is flanked by trees on both sides, their bare branches reaching out into the clear blue sky. The trees are uniformly spaced, creating a rhythmic pattern that adds to the visual appeal of the scene.

In the distance, a few cars can be seen, adding a touch of life to the otherwise tranquil setting. The overall color palette of the image is dominated by shades of green from the trees and brown from the road, with subtle hints of blue and gray from the sky and buildings in the background. The image provides a glimpse into the everyday life in Beijing, showcasing the city's blend of natural beauty and urban development."}
