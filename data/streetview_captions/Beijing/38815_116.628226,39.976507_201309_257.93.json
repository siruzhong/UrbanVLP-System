The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves forming a canopy that filters the sunlight, casting dappled shadows on the pavement below. A red car is parked on the right side of the street, adding a pop of color to the scene. On the left side of the street, there's a white building with a blue roof, its architecture typical of traditional Chinese design. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, illuminating the scene with a warm glow."}
