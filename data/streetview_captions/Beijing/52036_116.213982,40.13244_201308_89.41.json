The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves forming a natural canopy over the urban landscape. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades bathed in the warm glow of the sun.
