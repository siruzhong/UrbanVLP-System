The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The sky is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly in the top right corner, casting a warm glow over the entire scene.\n\nOn the left side of the street, there's a yellow building with a red roof, adding a pop of color to the scene. On the right side, there's a pile of white sandbags, perhaps indicating some ongoing work or preparation for an event.\n\nThe street itself is lined with lush green trees, providing a natural canopy over the scene. In the distance, power lines stretch across the sky, a common sight in many urban areas. The image beautifully encapsulates the blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
