On the right side, a tall tower with a white antenna reaches towards the sky, symbolizing the blend of traditional and modern architecture that characterizes Beijing.\n\nThe image does not contain any text or specific actions being performed by objects. The relative positions of the objects suggest a well-planned urban layout, with buildings and trees neatly arranged along the street. The image does not provide enough detail to count the exact number of objects or identify specific types of objects beyond what has been described. The colors in the image are predominantly green from the trees and bushes, blue from the sky, and red and white from the building and antenna respectively."}
