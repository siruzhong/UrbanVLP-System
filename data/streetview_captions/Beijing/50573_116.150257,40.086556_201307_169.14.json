The street, bathed in the soft glow of daylight, is flanked by lush green trees on both sides, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. A handful of cars are parked along the street, their metallic bodies gleaming under the sunlight. The sky above is a clear blue, with a smattering of clouds adding depth to the vast expanse. The perspective of the image is from a low angle, looking down the length of the street, giving a sense of depth and scale to the scene. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the green of the trees contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky."}
