The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with buildings on both sides, their facades adorned with various advertisements and signs, adding a vibrant splash of color to the otherwise monochrome palette of grays and whites. Overhead, power lines crisscross against the backdrop of a hazy sky, a common sight in bustling cityscapes. The image is bathed in the soft light of day, highlighting the textures and details of the buildings and street furniture."}
