The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The sky is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. \n\nThe street itself is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green. Power lines stretch across the sky, following the path of the street. On the left side of the street, there's a large billboard, standing out against the natural backdrop. \n\nTwo cars can be seen on the street, one white and one silver, adding a touch of modernity to the scene. The buildings on the right side of the street are mostly white and gray, their neutral tones contrasting with the colorful sky. \n\nThe image is a blend of urban and natural elements, creating a harmonious balance between man-made structures and nature. It's a typical day in Beijing, captured in a single, stunning image."}
