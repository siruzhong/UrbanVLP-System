The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the surroundings. The street is lined with lush green trees and bushes, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. A car is parked on the right side of the street, its presence adding a touch of modernity to the otherwise serene setting. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it, casting soft shadows on the ground below. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the green of the trees contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky. The image is a beautiful representation of the blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
