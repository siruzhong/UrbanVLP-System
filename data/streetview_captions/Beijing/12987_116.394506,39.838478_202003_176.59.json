The street itself is lined with lush green trees and bushes, adding a touch of nature to the urban landscape. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the road, their facades hinting at the architectural diversity of the city. Cars are parked neatly on the side of the road, and a few people can be seen walking on the sidewalk, going about their day.
