The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is flanked by buildings on both sides, their facades bathed in the warm glow of the sun. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting long shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings. In the distance, power lines crisscross the sky, adding a touch of urbanity to the scene."}
