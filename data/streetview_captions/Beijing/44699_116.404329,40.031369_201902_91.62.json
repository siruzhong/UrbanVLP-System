The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings that line the street. These structures, predominantly gray and white, rise high into the overcast sky. The street itself is a hive of activity, with cars and buses moving along its length, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static cityscape. In the distance, the tops of trees can be seen, providing a touch of nature amidst the urban environment."}
