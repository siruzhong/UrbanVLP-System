The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with bare trees, their leafless branches reaching towards the overcast sky, suggesting a cold or wintery day. The buildings on either side of the street are mostly white and gray, their muted colors blending harmoniously with the natural elements of the scene. The street itself is devoid of any traffic or pedestrians, adding a sense of tranquility to the image. The overall color palette is dominated by shades of gray and white, punctuated by the green of the trees."}
