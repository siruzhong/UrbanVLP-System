The perspective is from the sidewalk, looking down the length of the street. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves forming a canopy overhead. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow on the scene. A black car is parked on the side of the road, adding a touch of modernity to the otherwise tranquil setting. On the right side of the photo, there's a building with a gray facade, standing tall amidst the greenery. The image beautifully encapsulates the blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
