The perspective is from a car on the road, giving a driver's view of the surroundings. The road is flanked by trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. A car can be seen in the distance, adding a touch of life to the otherwise tranquil setting. The image beautifully encapsulates the blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
