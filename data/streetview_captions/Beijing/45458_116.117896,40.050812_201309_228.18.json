The perspective is from the middle of the road, looking towards the horizon. The sky above is a clear blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds. On either side of the highway, lush green trees and shrubs line the road, adding a touch of nature to the urban landscape. In the distance, majestic mountains rise against the sky, their peaks shrouded in mist. The image is taken from a low angle, making the viewer feel as if they are standing right there on the highway, looking towards the vast expanse of the city and beyond."}
