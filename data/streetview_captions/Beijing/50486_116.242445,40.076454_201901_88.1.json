The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly white and gray, punctuated by occasional blue and green accents, reflecting the urban landscape of the city. The sky above is a clear blue, providing a stark contrast to the man-made structures below. The street itself is a hive of activity, with cars and buses moving along its length, adding a dynamic element to the scene. On the right side of the street, trees and shrubs provide a touch of greenery, softening the otherwise hard lines of the cityscape."}
