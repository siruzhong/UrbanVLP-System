The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the image. The trees, lush and green, stand tall on both sides of the street, their leaves forming a natural canopy overhead. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it, adding to the overall tranquility of the scene."}
