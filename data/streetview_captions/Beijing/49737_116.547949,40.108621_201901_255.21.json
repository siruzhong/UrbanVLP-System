The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with buildings on both sides, their architecture hinting at the blend of modern and traditional styles that are characteristic of Beijing. The buildings are interspersed with trees, adding a touch of nature to the urban landscape. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The image is slightly distorted due to the fisheye lens effect, adding a unique perspective to the photograph."}
