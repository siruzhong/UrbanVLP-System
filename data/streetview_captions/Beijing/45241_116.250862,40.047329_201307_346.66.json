The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly red brick, punctuated by large windows that reflect the clear blue sky. The street itself is a hive of activity, with cars and pedestrians adding life to the scene. On the left side of the street, trees and bushes provide a touch of greenery, contrasting with the urban landscape. The image is captured during the day, under bright sunlight that illuminates every detail, from the architectural details of the buildings to the movement of the people on the street."}
