The street, bathed in the soft glow of daylight, is flanked by lush green trees on both sides, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. The sky above is a clear blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds that add a serene touch to the urban landscape. The perspective of the image is from the middle of the street, looking down its length, giving a sense of depth and scale to the scene. A few cars can be seen parked along the side of the road, their metallic bodies gleaming under the sunlight. In the distance, a building with a distinctive red roof stands out against the blue sky, adding a splash of color to the otherwise green and blue palette of the image. The image beautifully captures the blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
