The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves forming a canopy that filters the sunlight, casting dappled shadows on the road below. A few cars are parked along the side of the road, adding a touch of urban life to the otherwise serene setting. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, illuminating the scene with a warm, inviting glow."}
