The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees and buildings, creating a harmonious blend of nature and architecture. Cars and people can be seen going about their day, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static cityscape. The sky above is hazy, casting a soft light over the scene."}
