The vantage point is from a high angle, providing a bird's eye view of the cityscape. The street, lined with trees and lampposts, stretches out into the distance, flanked by tall buildings on both sides. The buildings, predominantly white and gray, rise majestically against the backdrop of a clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the scene. The image is slightly distorted due to the fisheye lens effect, adding a unique perspective to the urban landscape."}
