The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The sky is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The street itself is lined with lush green trees and bushes, adding a touch of nature to the urban landscape. On the left side of the street, there's a red and white striped crosswalk, a common sight in city streets. In the distance, you can see buildings and a bridge, typical elements of a bustling cityscape. The image beautifully encapsulates the blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
