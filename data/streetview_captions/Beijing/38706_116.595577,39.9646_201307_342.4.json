The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees on both sides, their leaves forming a natural canopy overhead. A few cars are parked along the side of the road, adding a touch of modern life to the otherwise serene setting. The sky above is a clear blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds, providing a beautiful backdrop to the urban landscape."}
