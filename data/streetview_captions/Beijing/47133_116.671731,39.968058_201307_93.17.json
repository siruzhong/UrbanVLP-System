The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees on both sides, creating a natural canopy overhead. Power lines crisscross above, adding a touch of urbanity to the otherwise serene setting. A white car is seen driving down the road, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static scene. The sky above is hazy, casting a soft light over the landscape. The colors in the image are predominantly green and gray, reflecting the harmonious blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
