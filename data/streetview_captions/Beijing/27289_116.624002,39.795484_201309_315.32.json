The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street, divided by a median, stretches out ahead, flanked by buildings on both sides. The buildings, painted in shades of white and gray, stand tall against the backdrop of a clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. In the distance, power lines crisscross the sky, adding a touch of urban charm to the landscape. The image beautifully encapsulates the essence of a busy city street in Beijing."}
