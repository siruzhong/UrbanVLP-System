The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees and buildings, creating a harmonious blend of nature and architecture. The buildings, predominantly white and gray, are punctuated with occasional red and blue accents, adding a splash of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. The sky above is a clear blue, providing a beautiful backdrop to the urban landscape."}
