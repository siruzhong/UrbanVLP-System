The perspective is from a pedestrian's viewpoint on the sidewalk, providing a ground-level view of the surroundings. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves forming a canopy overhead. Power lines crisscross above, creating a network of lines against the sky. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city.
