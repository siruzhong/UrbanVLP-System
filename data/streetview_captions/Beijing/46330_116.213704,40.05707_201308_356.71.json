The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the image. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. On the left side of the street, there are buildings painted in vibrant shades of blue and white, their colors contrasting beautifully with the greenery. On the right side, a black car is parked, adding a touch of modernity to the otherwise tranquil setting. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The image is a beautiful representation of the blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
