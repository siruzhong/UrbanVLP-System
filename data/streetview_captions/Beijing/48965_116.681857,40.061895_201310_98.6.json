The street, bathed in the warm glow of the sun, stretches out into the distance, flanked by trees on both sides. The trees, standing tall and proud, add a touch of green to the otherwise urban landscape. A few cars can be seen parked along the side of the road, hinting at the life and activity in this part of the city. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting long shadows and illuminating the scene with a warm, inviting light. The perspective of the image is from the middle of the street, looking down its length, giving a sense of depth and scale to the scene."}
