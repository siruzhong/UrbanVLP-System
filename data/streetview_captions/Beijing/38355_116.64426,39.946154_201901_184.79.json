The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly white and gray, punctuated by occasional red and brown accents that add a touch of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun casting a bright light that illuminates the scene. The street itself is lined with trees and lampposts, adding a sense of depth and perspective to the image. The overall effect is a dynamic and vibrant snapshot of urban life in Beijing."}
