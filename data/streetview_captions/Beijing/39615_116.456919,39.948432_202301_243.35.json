The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings that line the street. These structures are predominantly modern skyscrapers, their glass and steel facades reflecting the clear blue sky above. A few trees interspersed among the buildings add a touch of green to the urban landscape. The street itself is a hive of activity, with cars and buses navigating their way through the city's arteries. The bright sunlight illuminates the scene, casting shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings."}
