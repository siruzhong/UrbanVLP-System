The buildings, predominantly white and gray, rise high into the clear blue sky, their glass and steel facades reflecting the sunlight. The street below is a hive of activity, with cars and taxis in motion, their colors muted against the stark urban backdrop. A few pedestrians can be seen strolling along the sidewalk, adding a touch of life to the scene. The perspective of the image is from ground level, looking up at the buildings, giving a sense of their impressive height and grandeur."}
