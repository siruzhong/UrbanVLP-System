The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves forming a natural canopy overhead. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades bathed in the warm glow of the sun. Overhead, power lines crisscross against the backdrop of a clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting long shadows and highlighting the textures of the buildings and trees."}
