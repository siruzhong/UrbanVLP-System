The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of the towering buildings that line the street. These structures, predominantly gray and white, rise high into the clear blue sky, punctuated by the radiant sun in the top right corner. The street itself is a hive of activity, with cars and buses moving along it, adding a dynamic element to the scene. On either side of the street, trees and shrubs provide a touch of greenery, contrasting with the urban landscape. The image is bathed in the warm glow of the sun, casting long shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings."}
