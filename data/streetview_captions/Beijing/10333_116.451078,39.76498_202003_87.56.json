The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves rustling in the unseen breeze. Power lines crisscross above, forming an intricate web against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades reflecting the architectural diversity of the city.
