The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves rustling in the breeze, casting dappled shadows on the pavement. On either side of the street, buildings rise, their facades a mix of modern and traditional architecture, reflecting the city's rich history and its embrace of the future. The sky above is a clear blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds, adding to the serene atmosphere of the scene."}
