The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the buildings that line the street. These buildings, constructed of brick and concrete, are adorned with balconies and satellite dishes, hinting at the blend of tradition and modernity that characterizes the city. Overhead, power lines crisscross against the backdrop of a clear blue sky, adding a touch of urban complexity to the scene. In the distance, trees can be seen, providing a touch of nature amidst the concrete structures."}
