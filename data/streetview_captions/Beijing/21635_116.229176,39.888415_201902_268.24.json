On the right side, a blue sign stands out, although the text on it is not discernible. \n\nThe street itself is not devoid of activity. Several cars and bicycles are parked along its length, hinting at the daily life that unfolds here. Despite the overcast sky, the scene is far from gloomy. The muted colors of the buildings and the street create a calm and serene atmosphere. \n\nThis image is a snapshot of urban life in Beijing, capturing the blend of nature and architecture, the hustle and bustle of city dwellers, and the quiet resilience of the city under an overcast sky."}
