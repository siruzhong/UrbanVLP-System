The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street itself is lined with lush green trees and shrubs, providing a vibrant contrast to the clear blue sky above. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. In the distance, power lines stretch across the sky, adding a touch of urbanity to the otherwise natural landscape. The image beautifully encapsulates the blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
