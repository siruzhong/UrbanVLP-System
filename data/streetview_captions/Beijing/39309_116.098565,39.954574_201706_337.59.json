The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with buildings on both sides, their facades painted in shades of gray and brown, reflecting the urban architecture of the city. Cars are parked neatly along the side of the road, hinting at the bustling city life. Power lines crisscross above, connecting the buildings and adding a touch of modernity to the scene.
