The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings that line the street. These structures are tall and modern, their facades painted in hues of pink and orange, standing out against the clear blue sky. The street itself is a hive of activity, with cars and buses moving along its length, adding a dynamic element to the scene. On either side of the street, trees and bushes provide a touch of greenery, contrasting with the urban environment. The image is bathed in the bright sunlight of the day, enhancing the colors and casting shadows that add depth to the scene."}
