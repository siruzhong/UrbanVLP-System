The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. Power lines run parallel to the street, adding a touch of urbanity to the otherwise natural landscape. In the distance, buildings rise, their silhouettes faint but discernible against the sky. The overall color palette is dominated by shades of green from the trees and blue from the sky, creating a serene and tranquil atmosphere. The image beautifully captures the blend of nature and urban life in Beijing."}
