The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of depth and scale to the scene. A white van is parked on the right side of the street, adding a touch of urban life to the otherwise tranquil setting. On the left side of the street, a gray concrete wall stands tall, adorned with Chinese characters that hint at the cultural richness of the location. The street itself is lined with lush green trees and bushes, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. Power lines crisscross above, connecting the street to the city's electrical grid. The sky above is a clear blue, providing a beautiful backdrop to the scene. In the distance, mountains rise majestically, their peaks touching the sky, adding a sense of grandeur to the landscape. The image is a beautiful blend of urban and natural elements, showcasing the harmonious coexistence of man-made structures and nature in Beijing."}
