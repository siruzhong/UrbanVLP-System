The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of looking up at the towering trees and the clear blue sky above. The trees, with their lush green leaves, stand tall on both sides of the street, creating a natural canopy overhead. The street itself is devoid of any vehicles or pedestrians, adding to the tranquility of the scene. In the distance, a few buildings can be seen, their presence subtly hinting at the urban environment surrounding this peaceful oasis. The image is bathed in the warm glow of a sunny day, with the sunlight filtering through the leaves of the trees, casting dappled shadows on the street below."}
