The perspective is from a low angle, giving a sense of depth and openness to the viewer. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The street itself is lined with lush green trees, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. Power lines stretch across the sky, following the path of the street. On the right side of the street, a blue fence stands out against the greenery, adding a pop of color to the scene. In the distance, a few buildings can be seen, their silhouettes faint against the bright sky. The image beautifully encapsulates a typical day in Beijing, with its blend of natural beauty and urban architecture."}
