The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with tall, leafless trees, their bare branches reaching towards the clear blue sky. A white van is parked on the side of the road, adding a touch of modern life to the otherwise tranquil setting. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow on the scene and creating a lens flare in the image. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the blue of the sky contrasting beautifully with the green of the trees and the white of the van. The image is a beautiful representation of a typical day in Beijing, capturing the blend of nature and urban life."}
