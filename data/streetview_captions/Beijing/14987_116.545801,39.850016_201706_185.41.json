The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with buildings on both sides, their facades adorned with scaffolding, suggesting ongoing construction or renovation. Overhead, power lines crisscross against the backdrop of a hazy sky, adding a touch of urban grit to the scene. On the right side of the street, a white van is parked, perhaps belonging to a local resident or a delivery service. The image beautifully encapsulates the blend of history and modernity that characterizes Beijing."}
