The perspective is from a pedestrian's viewpoint on the sidewalk, immersing the viewer in the city's daily life. The street is lined with lush green trees, providing a stark contrast to the urban buildings that rise in the background. Cars and buses traverse the road, adding a dynamic element to the scene. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun casting a bright light that illuminates the entire scene.
