The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees on both sides, their leaves forming a natural canopy overhead. The sky above is a clear blue, with a few clouds scattered across it. In the distance, a bridge stretches across the scene, connecting the two sides of the street. The colors in the image are vibrant, with the green of the trees contrasting beautifully with the blue of the sky."}
