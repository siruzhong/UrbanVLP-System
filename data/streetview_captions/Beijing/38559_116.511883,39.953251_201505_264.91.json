The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green. A sidewalk runs parallel to the street, inviting pedestrians for a leisurely stroll. On the right side of the street, there's a large pile of rubble, perhaps remnants of a demolished building or construction site. The sky above is a clear blue, providing a stark contrast to the earthy tones of the street and the rubble. The image does not contain any discernible text or countable objects. The relative positions of the objects suggest a typical urban landscape, with the trees, sidewalk, and rubble all neatly aligned along the length of the street."}
