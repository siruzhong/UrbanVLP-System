The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with buildings on both sides, their facades bathed in the warm glow of the sun. The buildings are predominantly white and gray, punctuated by occasional red and blue accents that add a touch of vibrancy to the otherwise monochrome palette. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun shining brightly, casting long shadows and highlighting the architectural details of the buildings."}
