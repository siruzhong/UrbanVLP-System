The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the towering buildings that line the street. These structures are tall and modern, their facades painted in shades of beige and brown, punctuated by numerous windows that reflect the clear blue sky above. The street itself is a hive of activity, with cars and buses moving along its length, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static urban landscape. On the right side of the street, a construction site is visible, hinting at the ongoing development and progress in the city. The overall scene is a blend of architectural grandeur and everyday urban life, encapsulating the essence of a modern metropolis."}
