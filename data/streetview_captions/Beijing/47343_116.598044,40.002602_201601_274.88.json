The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with trees on both sides, their leaves a vibrant green against the backdrop of the clear blue sky. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The road itself is empty, adding a sense of tranquility to the image. In the distance, a hill rises, adding depth and dimension to the landscape. The image is bathed in the light of day, highlighting the colors and details of the scene."}
