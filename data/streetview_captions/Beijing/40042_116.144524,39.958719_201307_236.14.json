The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, which is a clear, bright blue with a few scattered clouds. The street itself is lined with lush green trees and bushes, their leaves vibrant and full of life. On either side of the street, there are power lines stretching into the distance, following the curve of the road. The sun shines brightly overhead, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. The overall atmosphere is peaceful and serene, a typical day in this beautiful city."}
