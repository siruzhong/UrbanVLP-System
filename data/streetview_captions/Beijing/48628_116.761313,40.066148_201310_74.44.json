The perspective is from the center of the street, looking towards the horizon. The street is flanked by lush green trees on both sides, their leaves forming a canopy overhead. The sky above is a clear blue, with the sun casting a bright light that illuminates the scene. In the distance, power lines stretch across the sky, adding a touch of urbanity to the otherwise natural landscape. The image does not contain any discernible text or countable objects. The relative positions of the objects suggest a well-planned urban layout, with the trees providing a natural border to the street and the power lines guiding the eye towards the horizon."}
