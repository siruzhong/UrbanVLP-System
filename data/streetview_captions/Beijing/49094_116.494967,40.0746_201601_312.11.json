The perspective is from a low angle, looking up towards the sky, giving a sense of grandeur to the surroundings. The street is flanked by trees on both sides, their bare branches reaching out to the overcast sky, suggesting that the photo was taken during the winter season. The ground is covered in a blanket of snow, adding a touch of tranquility to the scene. In the distance, a building with a distinctive red roof stands out against the white landscape, adding a pop of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. The image beautifully encapsulates the quiet beauty of a winter's day in Beijing."}
