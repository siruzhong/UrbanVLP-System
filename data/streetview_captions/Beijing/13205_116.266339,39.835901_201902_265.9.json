The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with buildings on both sides, their facades adorned with various advertisements and signs, adding a vibrant splash of color to the otherwise monochrome palette. Overhead, power lines crisscross against the backdrop of a clear blue sky, punctuated by the radiant glow of the sun. The image beautifully encapsulates the bustling urban landscape of Beijing."}
