The perspective is from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and grandeur to the scene. The street is lined with lush green trees, their leaves rustling in the unseen breeze, providing a stark contrast to the clear blue sky above. Buildings of various sizes and designs flank the street, their facades bathed in the soft glow of the sun. Cars of different makes and models are scattered along the road, their metallic bodies gleaming under the sunlight. People can be seen walking on the sidewalks, going about their day, adding a touch of life to the urban landscape.
