The perspective is from the center of the tunnel, looking straight ahead. The walls on either side curve gently, creating a sense of depth and perspective. The floor, a solid expanse of concrete, stretches out below, leading the eye towards the distant light at the end of the tunnel. The image is taken from a low angle, adding to the grandeur of the scene. The colors are muted, with the gray of the concrete and the white of the lights being the most prominent. The overall effect is one of solitude and tranquility, a quiet journey through the tunnel towards the unseen destination."}
